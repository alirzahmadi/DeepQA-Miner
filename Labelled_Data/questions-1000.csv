The problem is, there are no users that I can identify in my project. My project is defined as a communication extension of an existing project, in order to integrate it with a third-party system.

Then get back to implementing some basic protocols, then test it at customer's site. Implement a bit, do a small release and test it. Seems fit for small agile sprints. But I am unsure how to write the Story-level tasks. I am pretty sure that either I got this whole ""user"" part too strictly, or that I can actually identify users for my stories.

1599,"pivotal tracker chore: Should chores be estimated or not? To give a background, We are web automobile company having a new and used cars portal, something like autotrader usa We have lots of technical debt pending i.e. moving our pages to new backend technology, updating the versions of various open source modules we have integrated, modularizing the javascript etc. The problem is, should we give points to these or not? Why team wants point for chores: There is a lot of legacy code that team says should now be considered as a feature since the majority of the team members never worked at the time when this legacy code was put to production. They say velocity measures ""how fast team delivers"", why shouldn't we count things like exploring new technology like a unit testing framework or new UI framework like React, upgrading existing software to higher versions, moving to better technology in the team's velocity, isn't these things worthy enough in fast moving technical world? Many times PO suggest to take short cut approach rather than ideal technical approach either due to business pressure or to quickly see the results. If the experiment succeeds,the same thing needs to be done in a proper manner. This is technical debt, why shouldn't we count this in velocity? Automating release process- this does not impact customers life, so it should be chore ideally. But it saves team's time and headache. Why we shouldn't give points to it? Why it shouldn't be given points: I believe if the team is smart enough to pick right chore activities time to time, this would automatically start showing up in velocity in future sprints. For example, if they start using a unit testing framework (done as a chore with no points), in future, there would be fewer bugs and team would be able to deliver more. If a team has to deliver 300 points in next 3 months, and they ask PO for clearing technical debt in the first month, so the team would be delivering 0 points in the first month. But the team should pick stories that would clear all technical hurdles so that team now can deliver 300 points in next 2 months.

4468,"Is there a name for this PERT-like project management status chart? I know of a long-standing program where a particular format of project status chart has been in use for more than a decade. It was originally created to status the assembly sequence of a complex device (M) and thus acquired the name ""M"" Assembly Sequence Chart (MASC). Although this chart format has since been re-purposed to status all sorts of projects with complicated dependencies, the acronym has stuck and MASC is all I know it by. Does this type of chart have a common industry name? I'm trying to learn more about it and look for tools to help me create automatically and status them. I know it looks similar to a classic PERT chart, but I see a few key differences and am wondering if these particular specializations are codified in their own variant. For example: The PERT chart focuses on spans, which is useful for generating a schedule and understanding the critical path. The MASC is used once the schedule has been established and is used to show progress against dates. The MASC uses color codes to show progress, rather than schedule data like critical path In practice, when estimated or actual start and finish dates don't line up with the plan the old dates are not removed but struck-through and the new date put above (although this isn't shown in the example).",sch,-,-,p,1,0
1672,"Does it make sense to require developers to write a “business value add” section in each issue? Background In our company we demand that engineers write a brief one liner section in each ticket they work on (from jira/github/gitlab etc) that explains the ""business requirement"".. the logic of that is explained here (text copied from our ""issue protocol"" document verbatim): Business Value add The software projects we work on must always ultimately serve a business need. Simply put b/c at the end of the day, someone should be paying for the development of these tasks. Therefore, it's very important to express the value add of the task in a language that non-technical person can understand and appreciate. Think about it in the following scenario: we bill the client per issue (ie in the monthly invoice we add the issue number and description in a spreadsheet). For the client to know where their money is going, they should be able to read the issue business requirement and immediately understand it. This isn't the job of the PM on the project, this is the job of the engineer working on the issue as they're the one most familiar with it. If you need help expressing the business value of the technical work you're doing, contact your PM and they can give you a hand. Business Value add instructions Must be a one liner don’t write a whole detailed description of the requirement and the reason behind it and the background etc. Simply state the business value of what the task is about. Must be a parent task No need to write business requirements for subtasks. The business requirement for the subtasks can be inferred from the parent task Must explain the business value add, not just describe a problem People don’t pay engineers to report a problem. They pay them to fix it. That’s why the business value add section should simply state the value added by doing it. Bad example Users won't be able to successfully checkout using valid credit cards. Good Example Fix bug preventing using from successfully checking out by using valid credit cards Must use the imperative mood This is best explained here. Similar to the git commit messages, business value should be written in imperative mood, which is “spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction”. A few examples: Clean your room Close the door Take out the trash Please see above link for more thorough explanation I have used this policy with several teams/startups with mixed results. But I was going over the book Software Requirements and it showed this image: and it shows ""business requirements"" as high level business objectives that belong in the vision and scope document, rather than ""functional requirements specification"" doc. Question Does it make sense to ask engineers to put a Business Value Add section in each issue they work on? Let's assume that engineers aren't trained for that kind of documentation (from my own experience, it's a hit or miss chance that engineers will be able to properly write a business requirement section, most of the time they do it just as getting through the motions and they don't really do a good job) then the next question is: does it make sense for anyone to write a business requirement section for each issue.. be it a BA or a PM etc? Update I just wanted to clarify something. Basically I guess my question makes more sense if given the context that the engineers doing the work are not from the same organization that's paying for the work. Classic example: entrepreneur outsources software work to a software shop, and pays them. The question I get all the time from such entrepreneurs is: where is all my money going? By requiring that the outsourcing company fill in the business value add section (and this is why it doesn't have to be an engineer doing it.. it could be the PM/BA from the outsourcing company), then the client gets a lot more visibility on where they're money is going, and I think that's fair (it better be, the client can simply make that a requirement when signing the contract).",sco,-,-,p,1,1

1539,"Parallel workflows: Preparation at a low-level, while management sorts things out at a high-level Introduction: My organization is embarking on a corporate asset management project. The corporation knows that it needs to do comprehensive asset management on all its assets, in a single, easy-to-use data location. The idea is that asset-inventory data from several specialized systems will be periodically exported & imported to a single location, for the purpose of organization-wide analysis and reporting. The Situation - High-level: Management is currently in the process of figuring out: What they want How they want it Why they want it They're doing what they refer to as ""starting with the end in mind"". While I wouldn't say they are employing any sort of project management practices, they are trying to 'figure their poop out' at a high-level. This makes good-enough sense to me. (This is a bureaucratic organization; it will take 1-3 years for this planning to be completed.) The Situation - Low-level: Down at the worker-bee level, a few of us are working on 'getting the organization's poop together'. In other words, we're preparing. We know that the details of the project are subject to change; heck, they haven't even been defined yet. But we have a general idea of where it's going, and we know that our data needs a lot of work to get there. And we know that we should start thinking about the framework that will be needed for this initiative. The Question: We generally have the support of our immediate management. They know that being prepared is smart, and we've been successful doing things this way in the past. But we face fierce criticism from other stakeholders. They accuse us of putting the 'carriage before the horse', and think that the details(data) will just work themselves out, when the time comes. It's not that we think that they're 100% wrong (there is some sense to what they're saying), nor are we looking for help to argue with them. However, we would like to make some sense of this sort of parallel-workflow that's we've come up with, so that we can refine it and communicate it better. It could be visualized something like this: Project Planning Project is underway Project Complete ---->---->---->---->---->---->---->---->---->---->---->---->---->---->----|  ^ Preparation | ---->---->---->---->---->-----  \  Implement!

1670,"Benefits for the development team from adopting the Behavior Driven Development I've been working for this company for about 5 months. They had very aggressive hiring policy and the result was that the development teams were build fairly quick and we started contributing to the product's code base without any formal development process in place. At the beginning most of the people were confused, not knowing what to do, since the product is fairly big, the code base is old and there is a lot of confusing code and few people with enough experience to explain what's going on. During this period it was obvious that everyone is acting chaotic and back then the need from some formal approach was obvious. However time passed by and now the people have gained some confidence, some experience, knowing a little more about what is expected from them and I would say, they already started to feel comfortable as it is. And now I'm given the opportunity to try and convince some of those people (the team that I am part of) to try and adopt the BDD. If this had happened two months ago I would feel very confident talking to them. I imagine how I explain them how we will get together at the beginning of each sprint, writing our scenarios, making sure that we all start with the same understanding about what should be done. Then, how there will be no downtime for the QA's but instead the whole team starts working, knowing exactly what needs to be done (eliminating that feel of not knowing what you need to do) and collaborating with each other/helping each other. Bu this is the picture from 2 months ago. If I tell them now the same things I'm not sure if they gonna be interpreted the same way. I feel that it's most likely that now they will find irritating to spend time writing scenarios (after all now they know what should be done or at least they think so), they don't feel so lost anymore so the idea of pair programming and spending more time discussing stuff is more likely to be seen as waste of time or even sign of lack of skills. Things like living documentation or filling the communication gap won't make much sense either since we haven't hit those problems.. yet, and last but not least I myself lost my confidence that BDD is actually something that will definetlybenefit the team. After all if the team members are feeling OK, if the management is feeling OK, then why bother to change something. Maybe things are going fine. This is where the things get very subjective and I need some advice. Do you think that given the circumstances the adoption of BDD is something that worth the effort. If no - why?

Staying with Actions for now, I've noted in the past that nobody on a Scrum Team wants to even look at a RAID log.

Given my assumptions, I would expect the 8 hour task to be broken up into 3.2 hour increments per day based on max units% for the resource, so the duration should be 2.5 business days (8 divided by 3.2 = 2.5) and start finish should reflect that based on the defined project work week.

3501,"Are efforts to improve quality an impediment to achieving schedule in Scrum? Let me begin by highlighting couple of roles of a Scrum Master as quoted by the Scrum Alliance: The ScrumMaster also works with the development team to find and implement the technical practices needed to get to Done at the end of each sprint. Another responsibility of the ScrumMaster as quoted there include removing impediments to the team’s progress. These impediments may be external to the team (such as a lack of support from another team) or internal (such as the product owner not knowing how to properly prepare the product backlog). That said, the ScrumMaster fosters self-organization, meaning that the team itself should remove issues wherever possible. Some other responsibilities mentioned include helping a PO creating and maintaining Product Backlogs, facilitating meetings, and making sure Scrum process is strictly followed. I work in an Agile environment with 6 Scrum teams, as a developer in one of the teams. We follow Scrum professionally and as expected, the scrum master chases developers to get all user stories finished by the end of the sprint, as we commit the delivery right during sprint planning (without really touching on the technical aspects). Now obviously, the scrum master is not expected to know anything about code or how time consuming/difficult a user story is; all he wants is the user stories finished. Now let's consider what Robert Martin has to say in his book Clean Code: Most managers want good code, even when they are obsessing about the schedule. They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion, but that's their job, It's your job to defend the code with equal passion. Alright, so here goes my descriptive question: We all know writing clean and maintainable code could be time consuming depending on the task (for example architectural work usually require lots of time and efforts). Now, if writing clean code and maintaining them is an important aspect in software development, why does Scrum assign Scrum Masters (who don't have any programming knowledge) the role of getting developers to quickly achieve 'Definition of Done' before the end of sprint? A lot of times due to this, most developers end up not bothering much about writing reusable quality code and just write a slew of code just so that the feature is implemented. Rather than protecting developers from impediments, wouldn't it be appropriate to conclude that a scrum master is an impediment towards writing clean code? Now someone could argue saying that scrum masters are supposed to do this so that the developers stick to their commitments and get the features delivered. But I think we have already touched on the point that scrum masters basically foster self-organization, and that the team itself should remove issues wherever possible. Its quite obvious that if the team doesn't deliver the features as committed, then they shall ultimately bear the brunt from the higher management, the thought of which should automatically drive the developers to work towards their commitments whilst not hindering them from writing good code. My point is not against having scrum masters, I definitely agree with all other responsibilities of a Scrum Master other than racing developers to get the tasks done. Am I justified in expecting the Scrum Master to allow me needed time to write reusable code?",sch,qua,-,e,1,1

3727,"Organisation fails to deliver a Product Owner I am working in a Scrum-team that has been developing software for the past year. The organisation isn't used to agile product development and initially provided a weak product owner who was chosen because of his functional knowledge about the domain, but since we're developing both a functional system and a new technical architecture, he recently quit this position because he couldn't find himself adding much value to the team. Besides the Scrum-team (programmers and testers), there is a relatively new separate project leader/manager who is responsible for budget, a software architect approving technical decisions and a requirements engineer (currenly 'interim product owner') who sees himself as chicken helping out the hypothetical product owner. And then there is the test department and operations. These all are the stakeholders in this project and the organization has trouble appointing a product owner, because they 'can't find anybody who has enough knowledge and time to take on the job'. Fortunately most of my colleagues are smart, pro-active people and we are constantly debating among ourselves to make the right decisions and I think we're doing quite well under the circumstances. However, not having a product owner does slow us down and demoralizes the team in my opinion, because nobody seems to want to take responsibility for the final product except for the project leader/manager who only appears for demos, when approving timesheets and in weekly 1 hour meetings to inform the team about future organizational plans regarding this product, but also giving us a chance to speak up if there are any issues.

The work to be done requires a software license that must be shared between my project and several others. This means that I only have that resource for a few hours a day. If I assign the license resource type as work it shows up in the project labor hours even though its not labor. That causes a problem for me to track the project cost in labor hours (there is no material cost). The only other choices for resource type are material or cost. Neither of those allow me to specify a max constraint.

2799,"Ideas needed on expanding Jira DB to include multiple target platforms So first I'll explain my position. I am a member on the QA team but tasked with majority of the management of the Jira instance. We have launched our product on one platform, and will be starting to develop it shortly on two more platforms. I am primarily concerned with just the bugs on the database for this reason. Tasks etc., are used elsewhere and I only really change those upon request. It has already been decided that we will be sticking with just the one project on Jira for this, for various reasons (some things out of my control etc). We already have a ""platforms"" field, where we have a select box for each platform, and this has been used consistently for all bugs so far. I have all my filters, dashboards etc set up to include / filter out the platforms as I require, so all of that is ready to go. The main thing I am thinking about right now, is our bug creation process and our bug regression process. We regress our bugs at a semi-regular interval, and is often the fallback ""if you don't have anything else to do, hit that regression list!"". What we will be having, is a process whereby when a bug is created, the creator marks the bug with the platform it was found in. This will be, for arguments sake, platform 1. This bug should show up somewhere that it now needs to be checked in platforms 2 and 3. It should be checked there and then not show up in the lists once checked (whether it effects them or not). We have multiple criteria for bugs entering our regression list at present... it depends partly on its priority, and whether it has been regressed in this build already or not. When a bug is regressed, a field is updated with the current date to show it was regressed today. I now need all bugs to be regressed on each platform each time. But if I dont make any changes, then it will show up in all 3 regression lists until it is regressed in one platform, then it will disappear from all lists. What I need is for it to only disappear from the platform field it was regressed in... How would you go about tackling this?

2096,"Estimate depending work items in Scrum Scenario: Let's say there are two items A and B in the product backlog of a Scrum team. From a PO point of view B has more customer value than A and is therefore ranked higher. When asking a developer for the estimated time to work on these items he gives the following input: A takes 2 days B takes 2 days; but if A is done before then B only takes 1 day (as some prerequisite work is done in A as well) This means that, when B is done first and then A, the overall time for those two work items is 4 days. But when A is done before B the overall work time will be 1 day. But this will be against the priorities as B is ranked higher than A. Please assume that both work items cannot be completed in the same sprint. Otherwise, there is no need for this question :) Actual question: Should estimates incorporate such information? Our thinking: We've been discussing this yesterday on whether the estimates for work items should keep this in mind. Should a PO have this information to reorder the product backlog based on this information? We came to the conclusion that estimates should not contain this information, i.e. B takes 2 days time, period. The reasons for that are: The product backlog is ordered based on customer value When B shares a task with A, what about the other items?

4156,"Agile/scrum - tracking time spent in current iteration towards stories from the next iteration if all current stories are done Our team has been slowly trying to go towards agile, and like many other teams, up to this point, the question of ""what do we do when we actually finish all commitments?"" is fairly new and foreign to us. But lately it actually came up once or twice. The reason I wanted to ask this board on good practices is that we are using Rally for agile project tracking and one thing the tool does is keep track of hours and points. In order to improve our estimates, I wanted to do something with this data and provide feedback to the team on how we did in the past, by comparing metrics that show estimated task hours vs. actual task hours vs. assigned story points. This seems like it could work great as long as developers work up until the last day of the iteration or if they are late with their deliveries. Then ""actual hours"" reflects exactly what went into each story. However, what should we do when we finish early but next story would take too long to complete so we can't pull it into the current iteration? I know some people are advised to simply take the time for general cleanup/housekeeping like updating automated tests or documentation, but for sake of argument, let's say the best value to the team and the company in this specific scenario would be to immediately start working on the next story. If we are not committed to the next story, actual hours aren't tracked anywhere. And in the next iteration when we do commit, we will only identify estimated/actual hours which will go into the next iteration, at which point the work might already be 25%-50% complete.",sch,-,-,m,1,1

We’d dance for the duration of the song as we discussed their projects, challenges, personal troubles, and so on. The benefits were immediately clear: • Meetings were kept to about five minutes— maximum, 10, for an extended James Brown tune. • Self-conscious people were intimidated and didn’t drop in as often. • The dancing immediately put us in a good mood—so much so that even people with major complaints always left my office with a smile. • It was a lovely, surreal bonding moment that boosted morale within my team.

The backlog for a given week is composed of development and maintenance (bug fixing) tasks. Some of our clients are entitled to prioritized support. We do have a separate support team but our development team contains experts in certain areas. Our boss sometimes asks us to change the scope of a given sprint to accomodate prioritized support tasks. In general the scope changes are minimal and the team understands why this has to be done. Things get a bit trickier when a client is doing UATs and is very close to going live. Sometimes we're asked to prioritize a support task ""immediately"", obviously causing waste and frustration in the DEV team. From my point of view, when facing the situation above, I'd rather fallback to 1day sprints until the client goes live and we can resume our regular 1 week sprints.

936,"What techniques do you use to establish scope in agile More than communications skills, lean techniques to discard useless features with no value, more than ask ""what do you want?"" or ""is there anything else?"" to the customer. Reading the book Agile Project Management of James A. Crowder, it says: ""Organizations must strive to provide an environment where budget is not centered on time and motion, but must be centered on the perceived values of the objectives of the project.... In classical EV change is bad and uncertainty is worse"". From the book Brilliant Agile Project Management of Rob Colle & Edward Scotcher: ""Agile embraces change and even encourages it. Change is not seen as the enemy, it's seen as an important part of the evolution of any good idea."" In an agile approach everything is speculative and scope never is closed until customer is satisfied. It looks like to me that these statements are for internal projects in software companies like Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, or even in in-house projects where there is an initiative to improve processes continously. In a context that you handle projects with external customers and projects with ad-hoc development, we are limited by the triple constraint all the time. What are the techniques you use to set up scope and minimize the number of iterations if we are in time-restricted contract? Edit *Triple constraint is the name that PMI uses to describe restrictions on any project in Time + Cost + Scope (+ Quality in 6th version of the PMBOK) Any change on any of this restrictions will affect the other. A change in time, it will affect your cost, any change in scope affects time and cost and so on. This is so restrictive, fixed and old in terms of agile. Once you have your baseline, you cannot change it, but through a formal change process. With external projects based on classic perspective, you manage contracts to deliver a product or service in a specific time and in a budget. That's why in classic approach change is bad. If you change your baseline (time or cost or scope) it will drive you into a rework or reschedule. Nevertheless in agile, change is accepted all the time.

2490,"How can we prevent project professionals from sabotaging the project schedule? I work with an organization that hires professionals with temporary contracts that last for the length of the particular projects they are working on. At the moment, these contracts are usually just a fixed rate per day. This situation creates an incentive for these contractors to sabotage the schedule of their projects, so that the project takes longer to complete, and thereby lengthen their contracts. It does appear that this behavior is going on. They are various techniques being used. A common one appears to be raising an ""issue"" or a ""concern"" which is actually bogus, or ""making a mountain out of a molehill"", but which nevertheless causes wasted time as this concern is addressed. However, it is difficult for managers to know at the outset that an issue raised was not even worth investigation, and it could be the case that someone honestly raised a concern that turned out to not be a problem. Although it is difficult to know for sure in any single instance that a contractor is sabotaging, it is clear from overall statistics that the practice goes on. (e.g. it happens more when the economy is down and contractors won't find another job). So the question is this: Are there any internal controls that can be adopted to help deal with this behavior? Is anyone aware of any incentive schemes/contract terms that could replace the fixed rate per day that have worked in dealing with this problem elsewhere?",sta,risk,-,p,1,1
4401,"How to make better software developers out of less-than-average ones? I've asked this before in other places, and I'm now turning to you guys to see what sort of advice you can offer. Some background: I'm a project manager at an offshore company. I’m in no way the best that’s out there. Most important (or so I believe) is that I am just as good as my team is. I've been at it for the last 3 years. I don't get to choose the people I work with (can't hire or fire people). We are using all sorts of methodologies (agile, scrum, waterfall, RUP, you-name-it). We are holding both weekly and milestone meetings in which we are trying to learn what went wrong/right. So,this is not a question of motivation (my employer is paying them more than fair, they get full employment benefits, etc ), nor one of simply teaching them new skills. This is more about addressing a problem within the mind-set of the average developer. I've worked with a lot of people both good and bad during the years. There were a few of them exceptional, but most of them were less-than average. Most of the times I'm usually confronted with guys that are getting stuck way to often, guys that are skipping solutions as they are not careful enough to see past their own coding mistakes and guys that are simply drifting away from the tasks to wherever their day-dream takes them. I was wondering if (and how) can they be determined to properly pay attention to their work, to be able to determine solutions and to unstuck themselves without me having to check on their work 24/7. I would really love to worry myself that I'm intervening in their work too much, that I'm always giving them the solution without letting them think. But at this point, I can't see this happening Some ways I've been suggested to try so far are: Make them read “Addison Wesley – Pragmatic Programmer” and ""Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"" – hold periodic meetings for each chapter and discuss what they have learned so far. Hold some sort of ""Quick&Great Code of the Week competition"", using a new/unknown language for implementation – given that this would be a new language for everyone, this should give me/us an idea over who is missing what. Get the rest of the management team to analyze ""a great TED talk about motivation by Dan Pink"" and see if we find anything that works for further motivating them. So, I'm now wondering: is there anything else? would this approach work? I'm also worried that even though I'll eventually set them on the right track, once the current project closes and the development team gets reassigned, they'll revert back to their old habits. How can I make the knowledge ""stick"" and prevent this from happening?",res,-,-,e,1,1

3670,"Ideas how to convince old-school tree project management users to agile project management? I have a bit of an issue in my current company. We are implementing Atlassian JIRA as our project management tool for both business problems and software development and while the software development teams are enthusiastic, knowing fairly well how agile works and how projects should be managed, we have a problem 'selling the idea' to business managers - who are also integrated in the process. The way things work in JIRA and the way we have set them up is as follows: Each project is a separate project, maintained by separate project managers and software developers. Internally it has version numbers on issues and every issue has subtasks, which govern over different states of the issue, such as when the issue requires technical analysis, development or additional testing. Once the issues have their subtasks done, the issue is set to fixed and then, once pushed live, the status is changed to Live and the issue is closed entirely. This works. But we have a problem with business managers. Their old-school workflow is follows: They get requirements from different sources (upper management and internal development requests) that have not been fully analyzed yet. These may be badly worded requests for developments, bugs and fixes that need to be done but which are not clearly defined yet or whole new projects, like 'Make project C happen'. Depending on how 'large' their new incoming issue is, they used previous software to create subtasks to this first issue. And depending on how large those subtasks were, they created other subtasks and so on and so fort, in the end having this massive tree that grows new branches as it happens. Once the whole tree is solved, it is closed. This whole tree still has the original 'request' as the main issue, no matter how large the issue grew. This approach is problematic, since it is terrible for getting reports, estimations and any kind of structure out of such a tree. I've been trying to make it clear that it is not possible to think in this manner effectively and that at first they should simply send the first issue to analysis to see how many 'actual issues' should be created and those issues should be then sent to their appropriate departments for development and if needed, linked back to the original issue, for status updates on their end. But it is not getting enough grip, it's a classic 'we have been doing things in this way and we are fine with it' locked guard and there's problem getting the old-school thinking of 'endless tree' in project management out of their minds. Any ideas how to 'sell' the idea of project and queue sprint based project management? One of the problems seems to be that the users have a hard time knowing what to do with an issue, whether the issue is so big that it should be a whole new project or just a separate issue and where it should go next.

3217,"How would you implement scrumban to large team performing concurrent multiple R&D projects I'm working in a private technological center, performing only R&D projects for industrial clients and institutions... I'm looking at applying Agile methods to our activities. From all my readings, I'm looking towards scrumban. But I have doubts about its applicability and how to set this up. We have NO experience on Agile. All is based on project managers experience, PMP or intuition... So to sum-up, I think that my main doubts are related to: - team size for scrumban to be manageable - issue of resources allocated to multiple projects at the same time (and we can't do it in other ways due to the nature of our activities) - issue of resources required for my project but managed in a different sub-team. So first let me give you context, and then ask concrete questions: I'm working in a business unit of about 50 people. We have about 150 ongoing projects. minimum project time 6 months, maximum 4 years. Projects have their uncontrollable lifecycle with intensive sprints followed by lengthy dead time due to delay in the clients feedback, waiting for purchased components, or just fixed long timeframe but at low intensity. We are of many different specialties, so some tasks can only be performed by one person. Executing only R&D contracts we have LOTS of uncertainties and risks and almost no repeatability between two projects. But since we are a private company, we need to ship results to our clients on time, within the fixed budget and with adequate quality... All the projects (mainly related to robotics, machine tools, and factory automation) require many profiles to collaborate at different stages: conceptual design; architecture design, prototyping, testing, redesign, software, electronics, mechanics etc... All this is coordinated by project managers and our head of Operations performs a monthly resources (person hour) allocation based on a project/person matrix. I'm leading a sub-team, targeting a specific market segment, but we are not autonomous and independent (robotics requires a tight integration of software, mechatronics and hardware integration). So we always need to interact with the other sub-teams, get tasks executed by the mechanical engineers etc... So my questions are: 1. How can I plan my delivery date and budget in the commercial offers if later on we're using an Agile method, tending to Pull processes... Related to question 1, how can I maintain a Gantt or any other system to estimate delivery date when using kanban or scrumban??? Are both compatibles? I'm feeling that switching to iterative and lean processes will improve our efficiency and resource allocation efficiency, but that we will lose on predictability (on the other hand, I've never seen a Gantt plan correctly executed on time ;-) ). Is this true? On what team should I deploy the scumban: on the 50 people?? Hardly manageable, no? But if I do it on my 12 people sub-team, it will not be complete since I need engineers from the other sub-group to work on my projects...? So I would need to ""add cards"" on the other team backlog and try to fight to get them with high priority...? So what's the adequate team size? And to manage interactions between teams?? Related to question3: how should I manage the multi-projects aspects? I mean: should I try to impose scrumban at project level, or a team level? I fear that project level is not ok, since the resources in my project are also allocated to other projects and I have NO visibility on their current load and task priorities and emergencies... But at the 50 person group level, I fear that it will not be manageable, unless we perform micro-management up to the very fine tasks, with the associated management overhead... and headaches! I hope I transmitted well our situation, that I understand as quite complex, but found in so many other companies...

Flow is a mental state attained by creativity workers (engineers, writers, programmers, etc.) which is often described as a state of immersion in which time seems to pass unknowingly and creative work flows from the mind. Throughout Peopleware, there is the recurring concept that to engage in flow, privacy and quiet are the main two ingredients.

3649,"What pro forma documents do people use to talk to clients about web development This is a very general question and I believe it will be relevant to other people in my situation. I've been involved as a hobbyist in web design and development for over 2 years now. I have produced a number of websites but charged nothing or a token gesture to the people (my friends) that I've worked with. Going forward as a freelance web developer, I'd like to know what tools do people use to engage their clients with In all my successful ventures and going forward, I have used bootstrap, it offers the versatility of being designed from mobile devices upwards (I explain that to the client). One issue with bootstrap, is, it doesn't provide a pretty backend WYSIWYG editor (like wordpress does) for the client to use - This means that I cannot charge a one-off payment to the client but instead have to negotiate a long term arrangement. The long term arrangement isn't the issue, but getting there is. In many cases clients want a solution they can manage themselves, and I refuse to use wordpress (snob - maybe). So, these are my questions: Negotiation: Whats the best way to negotiate a long term arrangement in terms of webpage design, hosting and ongoing maintenance? I gather charging an hourly rate for work done when the site is complete is the obvious answer but how do people factor this in to their original project proposal? Template Documents: Are there any pro forma documents used for web design and costing that people have found to be beneficial?

3495,When to add tasks to stories and how to estimate tasks? In our agile team we frequently encounter the issue where the Scrum Master points out that all of our stories should be fully tasked and estimated prior to an iteration and once these tasks have been added no more tasks/stories can be added during the iteration. In my opinion this is very difficult to accomplish unless the item of work is fully understood. In my experience trying to fully task a story prior to actually working on it is difficult because : I don't know what the tasks will actually involve until I familiarize myself with the code in that particular area. Even when I familiarize myself I will be constantly reading doc's etc to improve my understanding and look for efficiency's thereby possibly making my original tasks redundant. Perhaps this is not very agile of me but it feels like the best method of adding value to the work being done. Am I just being too rigid or is there a common approach to solve this issue?

Although original product is in production, business is regularly giving new requirements or change requests. The teams are following agile methodology. While new requirements are clear, it is not clear how the change requests to a delivered User Story should be handled. Some times the change request impacts multiple business stories. Should such change requests be tracked as a specialised work item type and linked to impacted user stories and should the original user stories be updated to reflect the new functionality (single source of truth for product definition) or should the change request itself is enough to handle and let the User Stories be kept as is as they are already marked as done. Please note we are managing work items in products like TFS or Jira (depending on the project) but the process is similar. [Update after response by Todd as the comment field was too short to fit] My concern is also about the single source of truth. As we get past initial releases, the design of the software tends to degrade due to local fixes in absence of a complete view. Many times the change request user stories only focus on local aspects and developers loose the big picture. This can be avoided by the CR updating the original US and then the US being part of the work rather than the CR. CR would simply be linked to impacting US. CR can still be considered for work item tracking. But the acceptance tests would still be from the US. Does this sound practical? This should also help new team members joining.

There are around a dozen tutors and a dozen students at any one time. Currently timetabling is done in an arcane way; the week is divided into 5 x 8 slots, so there is one Microsoft word template showing this table. Then the secretary creates one copy for each student and one copy for each teacher and fills all the slots in by hand. This means that every lesson has to get written into two separate documents, one for the student and one for the teacher. This means that it is possible for things to get out of sync. It also means doing it at all is a logistical nightmare. Can anyone recommend a sane solution? I've been looking through timetabling software, and everything I've seen is far too complicated, or at least far more complicated than anything the school could possibly require. It's small enough that everything could be done by hand, i.e. no need for some intelligent timetabling algorithm, no need for any of that complexity. I'm wondering whether to look at creating something out of Microsoft Access that is capable of exporting a word document containing the timetable for each student and teacher. Requirement would be: a table of students; each student arrives on a certain day and leaves on a certain day, they have x maths lessons, y chemistry lessons, z english lessons, but I think it's probably best just to have a text field into which their requirements can be entered a table of tutors; each tutor has a list of subjects they are willing to teach, but I think this could also be just entered into a text field. each tutor also needs to be able to mark off times or days that they are unavailable for each week, every student and every tutor needs a timetable. adding a lesson in the student's timetable should make it appear at the right location in the tutor's timetable. when adding a lesson in the students timetable, the secretary should be able to visually see the availability of various tutors.

3921,"Quickly explain how to make estimation work to an external business stakeholder Scenario: need to quickly explain how the estimation will work to an external business stakeholder; can't take more than few minutes really. The project area is web development. P.S. There's no point in mentioning Agile, SCRUM and other terms that the business stakeholder doesn't really care about. All she cares about is producing ""good"" (or ""decent"") estimates so that she can, on her part, reasonably calculate project/feature cost and delivery time. Here goes my outline: Components for estimation A component that should be estimated shouldn't be a feature, but should a deliverable: examples: ""checkout process"", ""user registration"" components can then be split into sub-components (for estimation's sake) e.g. SCRUM splits these into ""epics"" and ""user stories"" Any deliverable should have clear ""cut off"" points that determine whether it's actually delivered. When a feature is ""delivered"" it implies it is actually deployed (not simply sitting somewhere in some code repository) and delivers actual user benefit Estimates themselves When thinking ""what to estimate"" thinking about the following should help: component development effort (e.g. if you foresee there's a lot of manual work, or reading a lot of documentation, these increase ""effort"") - this is a ""predictable"" part component development complexity (e.g. if you know that developing this part is very tricky, comprising a number of edge cases, it will need a lot of testing, and therefore automated tests to be developed) - this is a ""predictable"" part component development uncertainty (maybe there's a better term) - this is the ""unpredictable"" part - if it is clear this part is inflating the estimate more than the ""predictable"" parts, then a ""spike"" should be conducted to make producing the deliverable more predictable, leading to a better estimate what makes a given task unpredictable? Examples include: using an API you've never used/seen used by others before; a task requires a technical accomplishment which you haven't actually seen being accomplished by anyone so far, i.e. don't know whether it's possible, etc Any ""deliverable"" or sub-component thereof can be estimated at 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 where 2 is the ""double"" of 1 (obvious, but important to point out) any component that appears to be larger than 8 should be further split - this makes estimates less likely to be inaccurate Any points I missed?",sta,sch,-,e,1,0

We often build 1 new site every month which is done by only one of us at a time (while the other one keeps doing maintenance work). So, when we have to create a new site, we setup a dev server and work there until it's finished, then it goes to QA and then we push it live by manually deploying it to the production server. On the other hand, we receive tons of maintenance requests on a daily basis. Some of them we have to do it directly on the live site and sometimes we create a staging server from the live one, do the work and then push live. Since it's only 1 developer at a time, we don't create different branches on the GIT repositories. We just push the changes to the master branch of every project, and next! Therefore, I have been thinking if we could implement at least part of the Scrum framework on this environment of multiple mini projects. Does anyone know how can we achieve this here?

I have a lot of experience of waterfall-style deliveries (or more accurately, incremental waterfall since I don't know of anyone who still does actual rigid waterfall any more), but none whatsoever in Agile-style deliveries. I am considering how risk management is currently done in a well-run software delivery project and trying to figure out how it would be done in an Agile-style project. I have read the Agile manifesto. I have read this question and its answers The barrier I keep coming up against is that the documentation and thinking around Agile-style deliveries focuses on the actual software build and delivery process, whereas more often that not the actual software build is just a part of an overall system/software delivery, which itself encompasses many moving parts to achieve a successful outcome. So I would typically identify and actively manage risks that are largely external to the software build process. As examples, by no means exhaustive, I might consider the following: How ready are the users for devoting time to UAT? Can I achieve UAT without impacting materially on users' day jobs? How can I handle the push back? What are the risks of not getting key technical resources (human or mechanical) by the time I need them? How can I mitigate that and/or provide contingencies? What are the risks that the outbound data feed/integration that we are developing will not be acceptable within the downstream systems? Are the other teams, that are responsible for the downstream systems, ready for a new data feed? Can it be incorporated into their release cycles? Will their test environments be ready and sufficiently capable? Etc.

This includes one week of development and one week of testing. Each team (currently 7 teams building on each other!) currently has its own Definition of Ready and Definition of Done. This means that there are often strong problems in the process of testing and delivery to the next stage. Problems that arise: Partly late deliveries, from development to the next development stage Unclear definition of when, what, where to ship (even with different build times) Unclear circumstances which team tests when, where, what. It starts with the team that should use the Unit Test, only doing Functional Tests. However, other teams build on the only partially tested products. This results in a spiral of mistakes. Some teams have a staging process, others only partially. Pre-production is missing. Approach (My suggestion) Analysis of the process with all participants Use a new global definition of Ready and Done that clearly defines all teams when something needs to be done. Standardize the staging problem by introducing clear structures and unit testing. This allows you to intervene at an early stage in case of misconduct. I've thought about some points, but I need your advice here: The team's own definition of Ready and Done should remain in place. The global definition of Ready and Done should only describe the individual stages (delivery to the next test days). Questions: Am I right with my approach?

For many engineers on the team, these goals will include product impact, automation and code coverage, new responsibilities, etc. I am considering working with individuals to set quarterly story point goals as well. On the surface, this makes sense: as a team quarter to quarter we're always trying to improve velocity, so it makes sense to attempt to improve velocity at an individual level as well. However, I have reservations (... as evidenced by the fact that I'm asking a question on Stack Exchange... :) ). Completing stories is generally a team effort and relies on different roles within the team (engineering, design, QA, etc) coming together, so the goal isn't entirely within an individual's control. I also wonder if setting these individual goals creates a bad culture within the team where people are optimizing for individual story point credit rather than total team accomplishments or velocity.

2382,"Project management methodologies for multiple projects, small teams, diverse skills, partially remote team I have been reading a lot on Scrum to evaluate its use in our company. I've done a few trials runs with it where the teams were exploring different aspects of it to get some real world feel. I'm not sure though that Scrum is our best option. I realize this question likely overlaps strongly with others, and I'm looking into those as well. Here are the characteristics of my company: Small teams of 1-5 people Many projects (almost as many as employees in the company) Virtually no one works full time on any given project due to scope & funding of projects Projects require diverse skill sets, so people tend to hop around A few team members are remote Some projects are process-oriented while others are research & development with no clear path forward for how to complete the project Regulated environment requiring time tracking down to quarter hour Given these features, it seems that having each project managed with Scrum won't work well since there's a lot of multi-tasking and flux between skill sets needed on one project versus another at any given time. Kanban might work better since we'd just focus on work-in-progress, but I'd be concerned about needing to properly maintain a ""global view"" of all tasking as well as making sure that timelines are still hit for each project. I can see applying a waterfall-like approach to the more straightforward, process-oriented tasks, but that's obviously not going to work for the R&D projects. I'm not necessarily looking for a one-size-fits-all PM scheme, but I would like some general top-level guidelines for corporate level management and lower-level guidelines for the PMs on the ground, doing the individual management work. In terms of tools, we use Jira for task assignment and management, but all projects are not managed with the same level of Jira integration. Many people still rely on MS Project, Excel, and/or notepad. As an additional note, any time I've tried to discuss PM approaches with team members, they are highly skeptical and cynical about adopting some ""process"". I am typically hiding it from them that we're even trying something out. For example, many eyes roll when I utter the words ""Sprint"" and ""Retrospective"".

23,"What is the definition of Work in Progress I have read that Work in Progress should be minimized, or that WIP amount doesn't matter as long as sprint is being finished. But I am not sure how we define the WIP, specifically how large the WIP items have to be. Am I right that it stems from the Sprint workflow, where each sprint contains N number of tasks / user stories or whatever (deliverables), and each tasks is single item of WIP. Then, because we are time-boxing the sprint, the WIP item size will automatically fit into some number of hours? Here is an example of defining WIP item: Bad: analyze all data from 01/2019 to 01/2020 Good: analyze datasets #1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, extracting metrics A, B, and C for each dataset This way, when using ""Good"" definition, even though WIP item is still pretty large, we can judge post-hoc, how reasonably it was sized. E.g. we can end up with 75% ""Done"", whereas in the first case we end up with either 0% or 100%.

The client is requesting significant resource at our end (4 developers, 2 testers, 1 pm). We develop in a Kanban-style approach and wish to release every 3 weeks. Whilst we complete between 6 and 10 user stories in the release timeframe, the client usually manages to do UAT on 1 or 2 only, frequently requesting changes - that we have a policy to accept. The client is requesting backlog work to be started when resource is available. After 3 releases we now sit on a huge mountain of work that we deem ready for client approval. I usually try to keep the inventory of unfinished work low, but in this case it keeps growing. We now regularly have issues with conflicts when merging feature branches to our release, costing us time and money that is not agreed with the client. The situation has been raised with the client time and time again, to no avail. Our higher management is not willing to put too much pressure on the client, yet we have KPI's on estimates vs. cost that are heavily impacted by difficult merges.

Are you still using the old school Excel for these plans? How do you rearrange tasks in a way the dependencies between them aren't broken and times are recalculated? Remember that using a MS Project file for deployment plan isn't a possibility as there are some teams that don't have access to a MS-Project instance. Some background: In my last project, during the deployment stage, we had to coordinate 6 'parallel' deployments (there are 2 different business lines + 3 different business regions). Each deployment was formed of around 10 high-level task descriptions, without too much details, in order to be a high level project deployment plan to be used across all teams involved. As we were dealing with 10+ different teams across the globe, the time differences were a pain to manage. I build up a rough Excel sheet with some semi-automated formulas to automatically calculate the time dependencies based on the task + time taken for each task. Therefore, when changing the time taken for one task, all dependencies where automatically calculated. Turns out that for the people who's not familiarized with Excel (or don't have time to check for the formulas), it wasn't easy to rearrange tasks. MS-Project was out of question because, as already stated, some teams don't have access to MS-Project instances. Besides, during deployment, all involved parts were advised to update that sheet and share with all attendants. From this experience, I believe that would be great if there was a way to: Present deployment actions, (maybe in a format similiar to a Gantt chart, but in hours?) where managers could easily rearrange tasks, keeping their dependencies and having their times recalculated During deployment phase, all teams could collaboratively check when a task was done.

Here are some of the techniques and their criticisms (IMO): Play a high level planning poker along with tech leads in the company - have scores of 40, 80, 120 etc., Issue: No one knows what the heck they are talking about IMHO - it's easy to state whether a story is 1,2,3,5, 8 etc. but not many seem to understand the difference between an 80 or a 120 - folks would rather just go with higher estimates to be conservative (better to just guess a random number) Use parametric modeling tools like COCOMO or SLIM and the like. Issue - input is either SLOCs (which are just pure guesses and even more difficult with disparate technologies) or Function Points (FPs - not quite easy to do either). Although they may give good estimates as outputs, they are only as good as their inputs Work/Epic Breakdown Structure - I feel this is the best 'right' balance between the above two extremes i.e. breakdown epics, top-down into features to get an idea of scope. (one can also quickly come up with high-level one line stories for each feature (or if feature = story, in your case, then high-level features). Since stories usually range from 1 - 13 in the fibonacci scale (i.e., quite common IMHO to see stories in this range), just give every story/feature a score of 5 and aggregate them to get the score of the epic for a rough initial estimate (since there will be quite a few less than 5 as there will be more than 5, I feel 5 is a good mid-point/average to go by). The last bullet method is what I'm leaning towards but am more than welcome for suggestions/inputs on what have you practiced and been sufficiently happy with and avoiding estimation paralysis - yes the estimates will be refined later on, but we still need a very high level view to balance expectations and plan accordingly :)",sch,sco,-,p,1,1

The one guy only talks about an integrated vision, process model, role-hierarchy, ...; the other about use-cases, business expectations for next month, ... I am prepared to act the counter part for them when working individually, so that I pull them both towards the center by asking the Top-Down guy what his expected benefits for day-to-day business are, and by asking the Bottom-Up guy how he plans to control integration with the other teams. But when we're in a meeting, I don't know how to keep them from circling around each other a la win by changing the point of view of the argument. I can't counter them in a controlled fashion, since they already counter each other, albeit in the form of provocation and not sincere questions.

Let us assume we begin with the Scrum workflow and our project is following a hybrid Scrum/Waterfall model (for a moment, ignore the controversy that statement may create). Assume that you have full rights to customize the TFS project area as you please and that all features in TFS 2015 product suite are available. The scrum workflow has work items and PBIs and familiar concepts for code deliverable creation and defect management. The first assumption I would like to vet is that these work items are most appropriate for code creation and deployment. This may be a bad assumption given that Task for example is fairly abstract, so please correct me if this is wrong. Let us then assume that in addition to the software product there are a number of other deliverables which must be produced for the project to be a success, but that these deliverables are not deployable as part of the software: Design Documentation Standards Documentation 'Change Requests' Socialized ""Key Decisions"" which may dictate design patterns and strategies Each having its own logical set of steps to progress towards its own definition of done (reviews, signoffs etc). When is it appropriate to put items like this into TFS as a custom work item definition and what are the trade offs? Ordinarily these may be handled as line items in a MS Project plan. Naively, I am interested in putting these into TFS instead of MS Project because then TFS work items can be the single source of truth for deliverable progress, instead of having to keep a project plan in sync with TFS or vice versa.

This implies that several people – a team in other words – are necessary for project management to be viable, at least from the project execution point of view. Apparently, a one person team executor is not OK under the PMBOK. Here is the PMBOK quote: * Develop Project Charter is the process of developing a document that formally authorizes a project or a phase and documenting initial requirements that satisfy the stakeholders' needs and expectations. It establishes a partnership between the performing organization and the requesting organization (or customer, in the case of external projects). * Let's say that the project's product (it's final result) is nothing but a researched SCHOLAR book with such vast a scope that not even an awesome methodology such as KATIE TURABIAN's will be capable of managing the time I would need to juggle work, family, career and personal time. Bottom line: the result is indeed small (a book) but the result's scope is so large (book volumes) that I would need to treat it as a project under the PMBOK. It's not a book you can finish in less than 10-15 years. However, as with most books, it is best they are researched, argued, drafted and proofed by a single person, maybe only edited, published and marketed by a third party. If you accept this, can I refrain from searching for a sponsor and forming a PM execution team?

To illustrate: below is a one-task project. The task is five days long, has one resource assigned 8/hrs per day at $10 per hr. The task starts 4/29 and finishes 5/5.The task is set to use Physical % Complete as the basis for Earned Value calculations, and the project is set to not calculate Actual Cost automatically (so I can enter an Actual Cost manually). I set the project's baseline and all works as it should: baseline cost is set to $400. Then I set the task to 100% complete and the Physical % Complete also to 100%. I enter an actual cost of $500. ACWP correctly displays that value, and correctly displays the $400 BCWS. Lastly, I set the Project Status Date to 5/9/16, after the finish date of the task. What I get is shown below. I don't understand why BCWP is $0.00. The task has been performed, it has a Budget Cost of $400. Shouldn't Project show $400 for the BCWP on this completed task?

My motivation to tell the customer that they should not prioritize stories is simple: it is useless. These priorities change all the time, sometimes on every sprint, so the only sane way to keep up would be for them to be re-prioritizing all other stories, not only the new ones which they want to be worked on first, maybe some of the older stories that last week were priority 1 are now priority 2, or even less, plus the constant and ever-changing requirements make this harder, so why bother?

The company pays on the lower end and requires a lot of knowledge of niche market and custom IT systems and business rules. The two people, who got fired, were only fired after one year of constant warnings for not doing anything and watching porn multiple times. My team is working on a new system and two new employees got onboard with high productivity. We are on 70% of the project completed after almost three years working on it, but other people got promoted in other teams, based on relationships while not achieving anything. My team have not had a salary correction in two years and is solving a big problem for the company, and we are still below the market average Problem: the team got demotivated and contaminated with the culture, while before they wanted to change the company, but now they are becoming slackers. Management is increasing the complexity of the project (never-ending scope creep and unrealistic expectations). I am putting more resources such as external freelancers, but the more I put the more they slow down. Note: the resources are not redundant, but they focus on different areas such as QA automation and DevOps that speed up development. They know I am trying to do my best to finish the project, and I try all my best to give them the option of being self-managed and make decisions, but for some reason, they are responding negatively because they know the company is willing to pay external people and not pay them better or improve them. My current problems are: team members are lying to me team members are leaving work unfinished for me to correct team members are acting like they are doing a favor to me and I'm not the real boss but my boss team members are pushing more and more to take more time to do the same thing. An example: last year was two days, but now they are pushing for one week team members are decreasing the quality of work I talked to my boss about this and he said we can't say too much or punish because we ""depend on them"" to maintain an old system and the current system. The new system is being done in a similar way to the old system (very complicated without documentation), so the developers can build job security. This was something that was discussed at the beginning of the project that needed to change including employee rewards, but the culture doesn't change and it's repeating the same errors as before. Including the same developers on my team who saw the old team doing this, and now they want to become like the old team and repeat the same pattern, so they might be getting a shitty salary, but will be able to build a business on the side and maybe retire sooner.

374,"How to move towards Scrum when we don't really seem to be able to fit into 'The Scrum Guide'? I have previously asked a question on PM, which was not well focused, but I still received some useful tips. I do plan on putting some of the notions in front of my manager, but I would like to re-approach our issues here to see if I can't get any more insight. I work for a mid-sized American company (300ish) on a very small, not officially/organizationally recognized development team (3). Only one of us has a degree in CS (and it isn't me). Our manager is an manufacturing engineer and has negligible experience programming, designing software, or managing a development team (except for the past two years of our 'covert developing'). On top of this, our developer with a CS degree tends to work on projects solo, separate from the other two of us. We have an insane amount of projects our manager is looking to achieve. Essentially he is hoping to digitize most of our Quality & Inspection processes & paperwork, all the way to semi-automating our PPAP/PFMEA documentation. Frankly it is all way more than is chew-able by such a small, inexperienced team (in any sort of respectable time frame), in my opinion, but I admittedly tend to have a 'glass half-empty' attitude. So far our extended time frame hasn't been an serious issue to our company's President. Half of the projects are very large... our current project has more or less taken up about 70% of overall work-time for two of our developers, and has taken 2 years to develop, and still going (we had to restart the architecture and include unit-tests because we didn't know what we were doing when we started). Now, our manager (who, to his credit spends a lot of time reading on relevant subject matter to try and understand our position as developers better) wants to try and work under a Scrum framework. I have taken on the role of Scrum-Master, our manager as Product-Owner, and of course the other two developers are... developers. Other mgmt. and our President would be the 'shareholders'. My main issues that I am struggling with, and unsure how to approach are: Our 1 'team' actually consists of two separate development teams working on unrelated projects (mentioned in second paragraph) and either team can, currently, get our priorities changed independent of the other team's priorities as well. This seems like it should be 2 separate scrum teams but our manager/PO does not have the time for that, and I don't think I have the mental energy for it, currently. Also, how are we supposed to be accountable as a team for separately developed projects? Projects are all essentially interwoven into the same 'suite' and our projects kind of have blurred borders/edges. Even if we break projects into hard-defined boundaries... the projects are still quite large and our product backlog could be too much to navigate if it is fully populated Fully and accurately populating the product backlog seems daunting, as often times 'case-scenarios' are often overlooked by shareholders in favor of 'the ideal interaction' or they state outcome but struggle to define how to get that outcome even on paper. Sometimes processes get such a vague description such as : ""The quality tech would look up the relevant specification and make sure the document conforms""... which you can't turn into programmable logic on its own, we aren't making magical PDF parsers. More on the previous point: Getting vague, generalized process outcomes from shareholders has required us to go and talk to individual employees that actually do the paperwork, often times the nuances in their process will slightly deviate the generalized mind's-eye picture of the shareholders, which then often triggers long, grueling conversations where we as the developers are just trying to get the shareholders to understand what we need to know and why we need to know it... this seems incredibly anti-Scrum and I don't see how we are supposed to essentially design an enterprise-level software-suite if we have to re-explain why we need to understand case-scenarios and the nuanced details of the process every time we outline a new software behavior. Is there a way I can get non-programmers to understand our needs better? Especially when I have a hard time outlining our needs because we are trying to digitize processes that often rely on 'tribal knowledge' We lack personnel to be able to handle documentation, training, and maintenance (we often have to drop development work to handle these ""fires"" as they come up) EDIT: some of my other points kind of speak to this, but how granular/detailed should a PBI be?

I'm a software developer in a small team and I'm trying to help my Project Manager review our deploy process to make it better. Our product is made of multiple components with different update cycles, hard to manage and where features often have hidden side effects in other parts of the code. After features are developed, they are left untouched until tested either by our QA in full regression tests that can last a week or more, or by our customer herself. Months can pass until a feature is ready to be deployed. We can have many features ""on hold"" at the same time, at different development or testing stages, and the biggest features can wait even years of refinement before being deployed. Of course, when features are deployed they are merged together and the mixture can often be... explosive. This leads to bugs in the customer's production environment, which in turn raises suspicion about quality of code and incites ""more testing time"", which actually means more waiting time and more features to be deployed next... Continuous Deployment seems to be unfeasible because our customer (with good reason) wants to oversee deploys and her deploy times are long.

2647,"How to track impediments in SCRUM? This has been asked several times already but none of the answers fully convince me. We are an R&D team doing some support from time to time. Most of the support work can be included in capacity of the team so that the Focus Factor can be set accordingly. We have one ""batman"" that is on support every week and his/her capacity is lowered so that he/she can focus on customer support. But sometimes ""batman"" he needs a help from other team member, who is a domain expert and needs to fix some particular issue. If the issue is small then there is no problem but what if the amount of work is substantial? Should we create a new sprint task and estimate it and remove some other task from the sprint backlog which has a similar size? Should the story points for completing this task be counted as those of the stories that were taken during the planning meeting? In fact we had to remove some item we committed to deliver it so the amount of work done was lower than expected. Maybe we should we track the time spent on those instead and try to not remove anything from sprint backlog? In this case we don't have to estimate (which might be incorrect especially for harder bugs), just count time that was spent on fixing particular task. The drawback is that using this approach the velocity will be lower and if this is very unusual situation only some sprints will be affected. What is more, even if I could accept estimating the support bug and counting its size together with other tasks taken into the sprint during planning (after all this is the product improvement), I am not convinced we should do the same with non-development tasks (broken build system that developer needs to fix, access to bug tracker was broken and some developer needs to take a look). In this case should we track bugs and non-development separately and differently? It's clear for me that repeating issues tracking is much easier but I am particularly interested in the ones that are not happening that often and have a significant impact on the time the development team can spend on delivering sprint tasks.

Collective Kamban style management with a backlog of user stories and tasks and WIP limits. Adoption of Git Branches and PRs. Before people will not even use VCS software. Only Git was naturally adopted, other practices were eventually abandoned by the team since: Most students are dedicated to a project in a part-time manner. Students normally work for 6 months or so aiming to make a meaningful progress during that time. Students lacks experience and ignores the benefits of those practices.

Not sure if it's appropriate for my current situation, we have several on going projects, all of them are ERP scale size and most of them I would say are nearing completion(Ready to deliver). However during this time, there are a few customers whom we have no choice but set them as priorities so as bugs are still present hence if they discover issues with the system, they will contact us and we will have the team to sort it out asap. For now, this is the current practice. At such, if agile is introduced and we start using sprint, what can be done for add-hoc / urgent / pushy customers that requires almost immediate attention. Problem is the company is lacking in manpower, only 3 devs in total and there's no dedicated testers around, hence till date, there will always be bugs lying around and customers will keep coming back.

3343,"Project manager in scrum and communicating with the customer In my current project I'm very confused about my role and who I should go through in regards to getting information about requirements/stories and who I ask questions from. Project team: 1 x Project manager (this is the main role I'm confused with). Also acts as Scrum master 1 x Team lead developer 3 x Developers (I'm one of these) 1 x Tester NOTE: I don't think we have a project owner as such but if I had to guess I suppose it would be combination of our Project manager and the clients project manager. Project steps to date: Project manager met with the client to identify initially project scope Project manager and two developers met with the client to further discuss scope Project manager worked with client to identify stories and prioritization Project manager discussed stories with development and asked for estimation The PM needed this as the client needed a quote for the work Development team estimated stories but also had questions which Project manager took back to client (This occurred a couple of times) Project manager and development lead met with client a few times to discuss work/questions as well as future work. Rest of team members started development work. Team lead was stuck on other projects for first sprint only attending client facing meetings. Team lead decided which stories each developer would do and assigned them at the first scrum. After assignment of tasks developers started developing Towards the end of the sprint the tester started working on Acceptance criteria (tester did not work with programmers at the beginning on creating these which I thought strange?). On completion of a task the tester tests the story and assigns back to tester if not complete. This is the part as well I'm getting confused with especially: When a developer has a question about a user story they have gone back to the project manager who has then contacted the customer contact person directly We did not complete anything for the customer after the first sprint, and we are yet to start the next one. So my core questions are: There seems to be something wrong with our approach to agile here. But as I understand agile is all about being agile and favoring people over processes, maybe we are just flavoring it to suite our clients needs? Should developers contact the customer representative directly, or should we do it through our PM? This I have found hard because of things like ""questions lost in translation"" and ""time delay in getting answers"".

Within my projects I would like to have two different notions of time for a task: How many hours of actual work the task is expected to take A time frame for the task that the above hours should be done in My reasoning behind this is that the people working on these tasks should be very loosely managed and have a lot of independence. The general time frame will allow me to use the start date as a way to remind them of the tasks, and check in with them to make sure that they can meet the end date. I also figure the general time frame will allow me to leverage the convenience of auto scheduling. The actual work hours will make sure that I am not asking to much from any one person at a time (across multiple projects). Is there a more proper vocabulary for what I am describing here?

ORIGINAL QUESTION We carefully plan out a sprint and decide which stories should be worked on however some developers are working on stuff outside of this planned work. This is undermining the whole process. What techniques can we use to encourage/enforce developers to stick to the planned stories? UPDATES: Having talked to the developers we know they are working on the stories because they find them interesting or consider them important. We have tried no techniques so far except asking/telling the developers not to. Developers are working on both planned and 'personal' stories in parallel. The planned stories are sometimes completed but often not. The non-planned stories being worked on are legitimate pieces of work, just ones not prioritised into the current sprint. The extra tasks being worked on are not refactoring. We consider refactoring to be part of a story, not a separate story in itself. http://xprogramming.com/articles/refactoring-not-on-the-backlog/ It is only a small number of developers in the team that are doing this, and they are a mixture of experienced and junior developers. We have contractors on the team however it is the permanent staff that are going off-piste. The team has been working together for a few years although there are some new members of the team. We recently moved from Kanban to Scrum. We are in our 2nd Sprint. The developers in question have a history of going off-piste.

We work in what might be called ""bleeding edge"" research areas, across multiple disciplines. Various (maybe all) members at some point have struggled with creating backlogs. The reason being is that because so much of what they do is unknown in advance, they generally end up doing a small piece of work, in which what must come next becomes clearer (multiple new stories per exploratory work), in which it makes sense to work on ""what comes next"" almost immediately i.e. not wait for the next 2 week sprint. Give that the work our team undertake is not repetative, with iterations of unknown work that are required to be worked on ""as they come"", does anyone have any tips on how to plan a backlog multiple sprints in advance. To give an example - one day a member of staff might run an experiment in a lab on some the effects of some radioactive material on a tissue sample, of which the results need to be intepretated. These stories can generally be written in advance no problem. But depending on the analysis, some theoretical work might need to be done to rethink the problem, further experiments might need to be done to confirm a finding (an easy win in terms of generating new stories), or altering the experiment format is necessary. It is often the case that new variables / methods / software / hardware / even the fundamental problem may change upon the initial anaylsis - which yes the intitial phase can happen over a mere few days so I'd say one fifth of the stories could be planned per sprint.

4274,"JIRA - generating work log reports We are using JIRA to manage our tasks and to allow our client to review the progress and decides what to do next. Our developers are logging their work pretty accurately. Ideally our workflow would be the following: Client asks for a new feature. We create a JIRA task, assign it to a free developer and do our time estimation and also evaluate how much per hour the client will pay (depends on complexity of the task and experience of the developers). After some period (a month, or maybe when the new stable version is released) the client gets our report of how many hours each developer has worked and how much the client has to pay. Problems: there is no ""payment for hour"" field for the task (this field should be visible only to project admins and the client). there is no plugin or feature, which could use the logged hours multiplied by hour rate for each task and generate a report since the date when the client did the last payment. Because of this, we did some parallel bookkeeping in Excel, but it just seems wrong and takes too much time.

5071,"How should I get work from someone who “Talks a good game” but won't deliver? Background: I worked for an organisation that delivered services to a number of public sector clients, geographically dispersed. A series of security-related changes were required to allow one such client to comply with centrally-mandated security policies. Most of these changes were not technically demanding, but the volume was very high. The senior manager on site was a technical manager who reported into a different leg of the organisation from me. There is no question about his technical skills or knowledge of what had to be done, but he was recognised as being a big personality who had his own agenda and his own views on the importance of this work. The technical manager knew more about the client than I did, and because he was based on site there, had a strong personal relationship with client staff. I was based elsewhere, and had been parachuted in to create and run a project to deliver the things that this technical manager had failed to deliver in the past. His ""reason"" for failure to deliver in the past was that he could not be expected to both manage the technology and run the project - hence my involvement. Situation: I established the project, created the WBS, got the technical manager's agreement to the plans, presented the plans to the client, and started to push out work packages, which the technical manager accepted. He then failed to deliver any of the work within timescales, and, worse than that, started to undermine me in meetings with the client, saying that his estimates had been misinterpreted, and the client expectations were unreasonable. Given his personal relationship with the client, he was able to persuade the client that he was right, and he effectively hung me out to dry . His line manager would not intervene at this stage. I ended up delivering an incomplete project late, and finally got the technical manager's line manager to step in to support me, and we did enough to allow the client to pass the security review - but no-one ended up happy.

Sprint reviews are scheduled at the end of each sprint. So far, stakeholders have not been available, but the PO and the Division director attends. Every completed story is reviewed/demonstrated. This has resulted in reviews with full agendas such that there is no time to actually inspect the product increment. We are shown charts, spreadsheets and word documents. I asked my manager (Dev manager and PO) that we limit review items to those that result in product increment.

I have experience applying the Scrum framework for small development teams, but I do not believe such a management framework would be applicable here. Let us use Project A as an example. Here are some characteristics of Project A: Roughly 50-75% of the effort of Project A is a technical solution that includes aspects of electrical engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, and computer science. Ideally, the initial effort of Project A would take less than a year to complete Anywhere from 2 to 12 people may be working on the project at any given time, with each individual having their own schedules and priorities The time commitments from each individual could vary widely (an administrator/professor might commit a few hours a week to facilitate the allocation of resources, another professor may be writing the research paper, a grad student may be involved for 40 hours a week for a few weeks in the summer to write a program, another student may commit a few hours a week for the entirety of the year to integrate electrical systems, and so forth). It may be possible to hold weekly meetings of sub-teams, but monthly meetings would be more realistic (if meetings are even necessary) At this time there is not a defined set of requirements. There are some vague use cases that can be refined into functional requirements, but there would need to be a somewhat substantial effort to refine the system being development into sets of technical requirements. Project A is still in its infancy (conceptual discovery phase, perhaps?). By applying software/system engineering or project management methods to this project I can vaguely imagine the facilitation of: communication among team members, the thorough understanding of functional requirements while implementing the technical solutions, coordination of implementation efforts, and the collections of basic metrics (such as person-hours, defects per person-hour, or others) As I mentioned earlier, I do not think that Scrum would be at all applicable to manage the technical solution of Project A. My experience in implementing technical solutions involves predictable and consistent commitments of time, even if the teams are distributed geographically or across multiple time zones. However, I am unfamiliar with managing a project where people may intermittently start or stop working because they have other priorities in the organization (the organization being the university, in this case).

In other words: first week: dev is developing new stuff during the first week QA goes through regression testing of previous sprint QA works with dev on each individual user story second week: QA goes through full ""new feature"" testing Dev addressing bugs or working on completing minor stories.

The culture and approach to development projects we have moved to in recent years makes use of a lot of agile 'aspects' albeit it's not perfect. Our approach is rooted in being flexible and adaptive to changing project scopes. But as far as scoping and costing for projects there is something I cant get my head around. Typically projects are quoted for upfront on a fixed price basis, based on what we estimate it will involve but in my experience the true scope and requirements/features of a project don't truly come to light until after we do the user research and personas and establish goals, which inform the scope of the project, the type of user stories which will added to the backlog and therefore the cost. But obviously there is a lot of work involved up to this point which needs to be paid for also. With this in mind, is there a better way to quote for a project, eg what order should all of this be done in to make it more accurate? Does it ultimately still have to come down to estimating something upfront that you can't truly know until later on? With that in mind, during a project there are the inevitable changes to scope as it develops, some minor and some that grow legs. With an agile approach, using sprints and a backlog of stories etc, it makes it easier to identify where scope changes are happening but I am curious how others deal with this in terms of identifying things that are going to cost more and letting the client know the cost will be higher. For example is there an alternative to upfront fixed costing, like having an open ended costing approach? (one that clients will actually go for). After all this is the point of agile, that the scope can grow but we can adapt, both from a development point of view but also so we are not doing a lot of free work.",cost,sco,-,p,1,1

I was hoping for some advice on picking a workflow and sticking to it, or maybe recommendations on new tools. Any help / advice would be much appreciated. A few observations I have noticed and consider problematic : We are very ""knee jerk"" in the sense that if an important customer asks for something, we immediately work to push it into a release. We have never stuck to our release plan, and I believe it is causing a lot of the team stress. A lot of the prioritization of our work comes from our CTO and CEO, but that prioritization of work is not transparent. The general workforce, me included, struggle to keep up with what is important. Often times we run into scenarios where we are working on things that we shouldn't be. I think the usage of our current tools (Pivotal Tracker, Bitbucket, Google Hangouts) is poor because no one believes in the value of tracking what we do. I have tried being a pest to people about using the tools, but verbal communication seems to be the primary method of assigning, managing, and sorting work. It's hard to adjust resources, and nearly impossible to be aware of what people are working on. If you look at our Pivotal Tracker velocity, we are probably one of the least efficient teams in the world because 50+% of our work never makes it in there. It causes problems with releasing, testing, and code management. We struggle a lot with Pivotal Tracker because we have a lot of projects that are related, but you can't do any kind of relationship with stories across projects. Most of us work on 6-7 projects at once and Pivotal Tracker becomes a bit of a bottleneck for us.

Polar opposite: A sprint backlog contains 40 points of which 0 front end / UI effort is required. 5 devs are busy but Mr/Mrs UI has nothing.

I've seen solutions batted around, some better than others... Don't have specialists, teach everybody to do everything. I don't think this works. Developers can't design and UI/UXers are not going to learn Java overnight. Likewise we've all seen what happens when we test our own code. Have a separate UI/UX/FED team Personally I like this solution and have implemented it in the past, but it's oft criticised as it introduces a specialist team. It also plays with velocity as you're taking work away from the team. My chosen solution, which I'm looking to improve on The UI team is a Kanban team working alongside scrum dev teams. When a story goes in to a dev team's sprint, if any UI work needs doing a card also goes on to the UI team's kanban board. Stories can also appear on the UI Kanban board from Business Analysts, Product Owners, other Scrum Masters, Devs. The TODO columns is very fluid and constantly re-prioritised. Story estimation works as before. The difference here is that there is a constant throughput, based on priority, from UI. The problem you might have (going back to our all-UI example) is that when a large story gets dropped on UI this last-minute it becomes a bottleneck. The benefit with this system is that the product owner or BA could have dropped that on the UI team ahead of time. TL;DR Is there a better way to make sure specialist skills are kept busy in a sprint which you believe to be better than my chosen solution above?",res,sco,-,p,1,1
818,"Earning Respect of Team Members When I Know Very Little About the Topic? I've recently been assigned project manager of a project which requires moderate-high degree of technical skills in machine learning that are above my level. Originally a programmer, I have previously PM'ed projects that were less technical thus allowing me to contribute a fair amount. In my progress reports, most of my team members would praise the fact that I wasn't afraid to get my hands dirty and was able to help the rest of the team when they needed it. Now, however, I feel like I'll be the kind of manager who doesn't understand the technical side of things and just does ""manager/business work"", which is very important but seems to get a negative rap in the engineering community (presumably because PM's seem to have more prestige and higher salary for ""easier"" work). I'm worried that I will lose the respect of this newly formed team that I was assigned. How can I earn their respect, if possible at all? On one hand I feel I should I talk to my (non-technical) manager so they can replace me with a more technical PM who will be able to guide the team better, but on the other hand I want to take this as an opportunity to learn how to manage and more importantly earn the respect of teams where I am the least knowledgeable person in the room.",res,-,-,e,1,1

After technical planning meeting, where team divides stories into tasks, there are plenty (15 or so) of them to create. Sometimes there is nothing to describe within them, but there are also more complicated, which require some additional technical information. The other example are admin tasks. In most cases they have to be done for the sake of new features hence are created by dev teams. Admins are outside of dev teams and it is one of their duties, to resolve tasks that concern infrastructure. Sometimes admin tasks are known before sprint is started, sometimes they appear during a sprint. In each case they need to be well described, to make sure that responsible admin will know what to do. There could be many similar tasks to the ones mentioned above. My intention is to find a pattern (as I believe that there is no the only solution) when they should be created and described (not performed) by Scrum Master and when by the team.

3643,"How do you handle utilization rates for teams with members that have no tasked hours? Let's say that we have a team of twenty, and each of them tracks their time on tasks. They have a manager who doesn't track time on tasks because his job is to support the team, regardless of what task, plan, mentor and attend meetings. It's not reasonable to allocate his time to tasks. We calculate the utilization rate for the team by dividing the number of hours they tracks on tasks by the number of hours they logged to payroll. Right now a rate above 50% is good. If we include the manager in the team utilization, it brings the utilization rate down. This is correct because too many managers to non-managers should yield a poorer utilization. The manager is ""dead weight"" to the utilization calculation. In theory a manager can come on board (bringing 8 hours of dead weight per day) but take care of minutia on behalf of the team, this increasing their aggregate tasked hours by more than 8.... a net positive. This method fails when the manager is sick, or leaves early... or logs fewer payroll hours for whatever reason. If he is sick, then the team sheds 8 hours of ""dead weight"" but doesn't feel a long-term impact on their own productivity because he was only sick for the day. How do you account for his time then, when calculating utilization? I am considering giving him a ""free weight"" which is equal to the average task hours across the team, then weighted by the ratio of managers to non-managers on team. Therefore if the team logs an average of 4 hours, then the manager will get 4 * (20/21) = 3.81 hours for free. The result is that the manager always brings down the overall utilization of the team by some margin (so his impact can be visualized on a time-series), and his absence brings it up by a similar margin (but spikes are less severe).",res,-,-,p,1,1

It looks interesting, but one thing keeps confusing me. In its original sense, the kanban method is about signaling production needs as part of a complex manufacturing process, with the basic goal being to optimize production by using ""pull"" signals rather than push. A big focus is on keeping inventory levels from ballooning when they needn't. The current project-management sense seems to be about using a board with limited slots in each position (for example: to-do, on dev, on qa, release). These slots fill the limiting function of the kanban cards in the manufacturing process (while the cards in the slots are sort of like the manufactured product). To my limited understanding, the latter seems to be basically using the former as a poorly-aligned analogy; the similarities are that both have just-in-time as a goal and both focus on limiting work (but in a very different way).

Howevever this is the first time I, or any of the developers, have been involved on a Scrum project. We've are in the middle of our fourth sprint now, but I have a ton of questions (I'll just stick to my top three for now!) 1) Estimating in Story Points. This is probably the number one thing we struggle with during our planning sessions. At first I got the team to estimate in Ideal Man Days since the concept of Story Points was too alien. However, from the third sprint onwards I've tried to shepherd them into using Story Points (based on effort not time). Even after two sprints using Story Points I still get the question, ""what does one story point mean?"". Despite the hours of online research I've put in, I myself feel unsure how I should answer this question. I tend to fall back to the Ideal Man Day since it's the easiest thing for everyone to understand, but I would really like to give a definitive answer to the team that isn't fluffy or vague. Unfortunately, almost every explanation I've come across on the web suffers from this. Am I to presume that a Story Point means different things to different teams? 2) Breaking stories down into tasks My question here is how much of the story should be broken down into tasks during the planning session? We have been generating an average of four tasks per story, but some of these could be broken down even further. While I understand that too many tasks is a bad thing, I get concerned when I see the same task in progress for more than a day or two. So I'm a little torn as to how granular the tasks should be. Also, I've found breaking down a story too much during the planning session was digressing into a design discussion. When I raised this with the team they countered that they needed to fully explore the story in order to generate tasks and help with with the estimatation. 3) Technical Stories From what I've studied, stories should cover a feature of the product that adds value to the business. However, since we are at the beginning of the project, most of our stories tend to be techincal in nature. An recent example of this is, ""As a developer, I need to be able to create a MuleESB app and integrate it into our build environment"". This kind of story adds no value from a business point of view, but is crucial in laying the foundation for the work to come. My question is whether it is ok to have techincal stories and assign them points. I am concerned that if I don't, then the team's velocity will be very low and it will look like they've not been doing very much; at least in the early phases of the project.",sco,-,-,p,1,1

Daily reporting isn't extensive -- it should take just a couple of minutes at most. Also team members working hours are different and last ones leave the office much later than PM. PM has to report status daily to the customer every morning, as the project is challenged. Discussed person is working at the same office as PM and leaves at similar time.

3246,"Interview question for an Iteration Manager position   I am having an interview for an Iteration Manager position and they have given me a scenario to prepare for which we will talk about during the interview. The scenario is as follows: There is a piece of high priority regulatory work that gets assigned to your team. There is no Product Owner. The Business Analyst is split in 4 other projects to look after. Your team has estimated the stories and indicate it will take about 4 iterations. The Project Manager keeps questioning every estimate they have done, because he communicated to the Project Steering Group that it was only 1 iteration of work. More people get assigned to the team. There is high pressure from the Project Manager and Senior stakeholders to deliver on the estimated planned date. How do you deal with this? It definitely seems like a very Kobayashi Maru sort of situation where the only solution is a no-win solution. Here are my thoughts: Problems: No PO When there is no PO you lose customer focus. Without a PO you are losing the person who is helping the team understand what the customer truly requires in their product There is no feedback about the product that the team is developing Without a PO the team decides how the product is to be built. The PM can get involved but that allows the business to be unaccountable for developing the system. This responsibility is deferred to the team in this situation and this is not a good thing to have happen. Without a PO who is determining the requirements and assisting with the Product Backlog? BA focus is split between 4 other projects Find time with the BA to discuss the stories PM doesn’t trust the estimations from the team The PM is not the customer nor are they the person who can set the acceptance criteria The PM can see a demo but they cannot say for certain that the team is developing the correct requirements in the correct order / priority PM communicated to the that the work will take 1 iteration. Team estimated 4 iterations More people get assigned to the team It is unreasonable to expect the teams output to increase 4x, however assigning more people to the team may not result in the work taking less time. Ramp up time to get new members up to speed would need the original team members to get the new members of the team on the same page regarding progress and code etc. (Brooks law: adding man power to a late software project makes it later). Pressure from PM and Senior Stakeholders to deliver on the estimated planned date Was there a miscommunication between the PM, Senior Stakeholders and the unknown PO? Actions: Explain to the PM and the Senior Stakeholders that by not having a PO for this product the end result may be the development of a product that doesn’t match with the customers / regulatory works requirements. Attempt to break down the estimated stories further. By doing this, the stories may be able to exist on a more granular level allowing the PM to better understand the reasonings behind the teams original estimates as well as seeing the amount of work / effort is required for each story to be completed. The team along with the PM could triage these smaller stories which would allow for better prioritisation in terms of the product backlog, however this could be hindered due to there being no PO and the BA being split amongst 4 different teams. Regarding the PM Maybe some misunderstanding in the requirements based of the regulatory work? I understand why he’s questioning the estimates from the team, but I would trust the teams estimates as I’m not sure where he got his estimates from. And is he now trying to cover himself from blame? There may be a miscommunication / misunderstanding between the PM and the product due to the lack of the PO Are there any existing products that the team can use as an example for development? Best course of action: Make clear to the PM and the Senior Stakeholders that expecting the full product in one iteration will not be possible and that the team will try their best to hit the planned date with as many high-quality deliverables as they can. If theres been budget set aside for completion bonuses, it would be a good time to use it now as a motivator for the team. Stress that in future, any order for high priority work which needs to be delivered by a set date that there must be a PO for the work with a PM that communicates and trusts the estimates of the team and the IM. Depending on the regulations and the Senior Stakeholders / Project Steering group, it may not actually matter if it hits a specific date. If there was a PO this may have been clearer. Maybe the latest version isn’t compliant for the estimated 1 week iteration date mentioned by the PM but the product may not be launching until another date. Apologies for the long read. Any thoughts would be appreciated!",NA,-,-,NA,1,1

Each person in a team may have his personal understanding of the correlation between an effort and Story Points. Isn't Story Points estimation just a fallacy? Isn't it just a belief. For example, it's assumed that all tasks have a specific property - the difficulty, the amount of effort. But they maybe don't. And even if they do, it is just a belief that we can adequately estimate it as a number. The amount of time a task will take is intrinsically indeterminate. For example: During Planning Poker all teammembers agree that a PBI should be estimated as 10 Story Points and they go to the next PBI. This 10 Story Point estimation actually means nothing because everybody understands 10 Story Points differently (different amount of effort, time, risks).

I have the feeling this is not scrum, as we lack the concept of team. However, it is also challenging to bring the entire team to work on one microservice at the same time (maybe if more than 2 developers, it will get crowded). We are a team of 10. 5 core developers (service owners), and the other 5 from external vendor but they are part of the same scrum team. The external developers rely heavily on the internal ones in terms of specifications, code review, etc. My question, how to organize scrum team around microservices?",res,-,-,e,1,1

3238,"MS Project 2013 Reports: ACWP in Timephased Line Chart does not match ACWP in Column Chart or Table Version: Microsoft Project 2013 Standard (15.0.4420.1017) Hello - I am creating a report in MS Project 2013. When I create a time-phased line chart containing ACWP, the ACWP shown in the chart for the current status date does not match the ACWP shown in a table (same status date) or in a column chart within the same report. The table and the column chart show $10,401.45, while the line chart shows $90,401.45. Images provided below for reference. Also for reference - the ACWP shown in the report's tabular view exactly matches the ACWP shown in the Earned Value table in Project's Gantt chart view. ACWP for 9/8/2014 (Matches values shown in Gantt view and in a column chart in the report.) The difference between the two ACWP values is exactly $80,000. This precisely matches the value of a specific task in the schedule that is set up as a milestone and has no associated hours, but DOES have a cost resource assigned with an $80,000 cost. I am not certain why the chart is picking up this additional $80,000 when the tables do not show it. (Also note that when I export the data to Excel using ""Visual Reports,"" the $80,000 task is not included in the exported ACWP. Any idea why I am seeing this seeming inconsistency?

As in many other projects, we are also using JIRA to manage tasks and user stories, and Scrum as the Agile methodology. At the end of each day, the ScrumMaster provides the burndown chart to the PMO team. However, the first set of questions that get raised during each weekly meeting with the PMO team, are:- Why is the team not burning hours properly in JIRA - 5 hours per day? If each team member is burning hours (~ 5-6 hours per day) and logging them properly in JIRA, then why is the red line (of Remaining Values) in burndown chart not coming down as close to the Guideline? Who in the team is not logging hours? Why the team has to be reminded each day to log hours in JIRA? Frankly speaking, the whole team is quite fed up with all these silly questions, and all of us wonder whether we are actually following Scrum values, or instead just maintaining JIRA to show PMO that we are all following Scrum and have a near-to-perfect burndown chart. For me, I have always been wondering on three points:- Why the management is more concerned of JIRA burndown chart than of following Scrum values in project development? Why do some members of the team don't like to log hours in JIRA diligently every day? Is there anything that the team can do to make this logging of hours (by each team member) a more easy process, so that the management does not bother us by asking such bad questions?

We saw a project that was on track and almost ahead, and during the meetings the stakeholders were quiet and ""satisfied"" telling that everything was OK and they understood everything. However, after testing and ready to transfer the product to the end-users, a stakeholder told that something was not OK and wanted a fix for that. The PM was performing this near to closing phase preparing his final report, and shared this with some colleagues. As he was ahead, someone told him to apply the change to avoid friction, and I said that he should request a change control process formally. According to PM, the feature was a nice to have, but stakeholder insisted. We are always trying to be compliant with best practices, but there are some situations that make us think in an accurate solution. I was reading last time that any change that impact the baselines should go for a review in the Change Control Board and even more if the PM and sponsor are not part of it. However, minor changes that could not affect the project should be within the PM's decision/authority. Is this was a problem of communication or engagement or identifying well the stakeholder? As this PM is ahead of schedule, should he include the feature if there is no impact according to him and record the issue on the log? Should wait for approved change any ways? Or talk to the customer to close this project and incur in a contractual phase 2? This is risky as the stakeholder can be resilient to this decision and create a bad reputation for the product even if the product is fine.",sco,sta,-,m,1,1

I am explicitly not asking about the definition of the role here. There are plenty of articles explaining that e.g. in the context of Scrum. In particular, I am interested in the historical reasoning that has led to denoting it as an ""owner"". It might also make sense to share some context with you to explain why this question came up in the first place: My experience is that teams unfamiliar with agile methodologies tend to replace the term ""owner"" in their minds with some variation of a role they already know from traditional hierarchies. This often leads to an interpretation that puts the Product Owner into some kind of principal or even boss position, which may be in stark contrast to what one wants to achieve when implementing agile processes. To be specific, what people intuitively interpret might yield views contrary to servant leadership, self-organizing teams and evolving situational hierarchies. That is why it might be necessary to better explain the context in which e.g. the Scrum definition of the ""Product Owner"" role should be seen with respect to the goals of the company where it is being implemented.

And these products have submodules: Product A: (The bigger product) Submodule A.1 Submodule A.2 Submodule A.3 etc. Product B: (The smaller product) Submodule B.1 Submodule B.2 Submodule B.3 etc. Right now we have two teams. Product A team (Consisting of 12 developers) And Product B team (Consisting of 3 developers) And also we have two testers who are not actually part of these teams and have a diffrent backlog. In our teams we have code reviewing process which is done before an issue is resolved. So a code which is unreviewed by a peer cannot be marked as done. I know 12 developers is much for a scrum team and 3 developers is a small number for a scrum team. Because of this and for some other reasons we are facing some problems. 1) Product B team is moving at a slow pace and losing too much time on issues. The code reviews are not done throughly and buggy codes are being marked as done. The B team is actually not much like a team, everyone having their own goals. That is because one developer is always working on the core features and on an operating system level. The other developer is always working on the User Interface side (actually he is not a UI designer, but a backend developer) and the other developer has joined the team recently and working on ways and making research on how to make the product run with more performance. So the developer working on the operating system level is reviewing the UI codes. The UI developer is reviewing the OS level codes. They actually do not have the expertise to review each others code and doesn't really know or isn't really interested on what another is doing. 2) Product A team is a big team and the product is a huge product. It consists of several (like 10) submodules. All submodules are distinct modules on the server side (sometimes they use common libraries and common conf files, modules etc. but generally distinct) but they all share the same GUI (A java swing application is used to manage all these modules) So 2 developers are always working on the GUI, some developers work on most of the modules on backend side. And some developers are always working on the same submodule (For ex: Submodule A.1 and Submodule A.2) So those guys have much expertise on that module, but doesn't know much about the rest of the product. Whereas the other developers know much of the product except from those submodules (Submodule A.1 and Submodule A.2) Actually all of our developers are good developers who can handle whatever you throw at them. But of course some of them are better on the UI side whereas some of them are better on the backend side. Some have gained much expertise on a specific module, so a job on that specific module is always done by that specific person. This leads to one man shows, the failure and success becomes his not the teams. So my main question is how should we form teams and backlogs? Right now we have to teams (product A and product B team) and two backlogs (Product A and Product B backlog). Should we keep this? We are planning to create teams like OS Team, Platform Team, Frontend team, Architecture team, Implementation Team, Test team, Security team, Documentation team. Actually I don't even know how this will happen, we don't even have that much developer. Maybe one person will be in multiple teams, I don't know. And if we create teams like this how should we form the backlogs? But I think this kind of team structure is against scrum, because scrum teams should be cross functional. All kinds of expertise should be in teams. Or should we create new teams at the beginning of each sprint according to the sprint's needs. But how will this be (Who will attend which sprint planning meeting?) P.S: Product A and Product B developers are skilled enough to work on the other product. And according to the team structure you will recommend how many scrum masters should we have. Is one scrum master is enough or should each team have their own scrum masters?",int,-,-,i,1,1
407,"Does agile really promote a better work environment? Currently working in an agile role (Scrum Master), where the core values of agile is Trust, respect, commitment and courage. However, I am increasingly finding professionally that I am meeting fellow agilists who are doing a similar role that pretend they embrace these values but are more concerned about power, status and have massive egos. For example: I've seen in my current role, individuals who like the idea of being able to make influential decisions (in the name of continuous improvement) which impact many employees careers as opposed to doing the role with people's interest at heart. These Scrum Master's will act as team representatives and often make decisions either indirectly or directly without the team's consent. Arrogant Agilists - one Scrum Master I work with for example gets very passive aggressive if he feels his agile ideas are being challenged which totally goes against the idea of openess. I have also seen agile coaches who dictate and project agile 1000s of times in a patronising manner to the point people bicker about it. To then carry an attitude that if the team doesn't get it, it's not their problem and will go ahead and implement agile anyway by focusing on getting out of touch senior management to buy into it so that the team are forced to follow. I have seen agilists not fairly challenging decisions if it means it impacts their status in the company negatively. Hence, I have been the victim of agilists unfairly trying to belittle my skillset in order to influence management over and further their career within the organisation as opposed to behaving in a supportive way. In a moral dilemma now, where I am starting to re-think management/agile as a career profession. The moral dilemma I have, can you climb the career ladder in this profession by acting straight forward, caring, honest and fair? Does agile work to promote a better environment or is it idealistic? I got into Agile because I truly felt it was a more supportive way of working, but it doesn't seem to be translating that way in practice.",res,-,-,e,1,1

The development members are so keen for the process to work, they work well with the tasks, attend all meetings yet it's others that bring the process down it seems.

Perhaps this is not the right forum to ask this question but this situation has popped up recently and as the project manager, I am responsible for it. More than a year ago, we developed an app which uses a library that was created by a third party developer. From the marketplace that it was released, it looked like the library was free. In fact, even looking at it now, it does look free.. except for only one page which says the Enterprise edition is not. This library was downloaded 2 years ago so my developer cannot remember whether those terms were added recently. It is also not clear on that page what are the limits of the free edition which we are using now. At what point should we have upgraded to the Enterprise edition, I don't know. I cannot tell from the terms on that page. I have encountered other paid libraries that offer similar 'free' (or more accurately, trial) versions. After you reach the limits of free usage, those libraries show a message and no longer works. There is nothing like that for this library. I've also looked at other libraries and it is pretty clear when a library is free and when it is not. In fact, it's also obvious when a library provides a trial version. However, for this library, the word 'Free' appears almost everywhere except for that one page. It seems almost deliberate. So here we are more than a year in production with that library. Out of the blue, the developer contacts me and tells me I have to pay for the past usage. However, he tells me that if we sign up for a 2-year contract, out of goodwill the past charges will be dropped. Unfortunately the bill for that contract is a substantial amount. What is surprising is when I asked him why is that for more than a year we weren't informed about this, he refuses to give me an answer. I am sure he wouldn't need a year to realise that we have exceeded the limits of the free edition of his library. Especially when he could tell me the precise usage of the library from the first month the app was launched, and that within that month we had already exceeded the limits. What is best course of action to take? Our client is the actual user of this app and they will decide whether they will pay for this contract.

I know the question may be quite trivial but I haven't found any related to my situation answers. And I don't know where to start We have new start-up company, that has grown in to 10-15 ppl too quickly, that we even hadn't time to structurise it properly. To cut long story short I would be grateful if local experienced people would give me some advice on PM methodologies and tools e.g Waterfall or Agile(Scrum)? and what would be the best way of company structure? Perhaps there are some books or other resources where I would be able to learn about the subject? Our workflow is: Most of the time we have small projects e.g Facebook campaigns, small to medium websites and social brand development plus some small video production. Most of this projects should to last no longer than 3-4 days(in perfect world, but that's the goal of company), but in the end of the day lasts much much more longer, because of clients delays(specifications & content) and lack of proper management. Director still keep trying to run the company in some flat organisation style, stating that he wants to be close to our team and be involved in any aspects of any project development. And I love it! But instead in reality he stretches him self so much (by doing PM, AM and Sales and general CEO stuff) that we always wait for briefs, scope of works and content from client. As result delays and unhappy clients. We got some person to do Project Management(she is also Copywriter). But she is not professional PM. So as more experienced and tech person in IT I'd like to help to set it all up and make sure it all works! COMPANY STRUCTURE: To help better manage staff, delegate responsibilities and distribute work load we come up with a new company structure: CEO/Creative Director (Also AM) ^ Account Manager, Project Manager(Scrum Master + Copywriter) ^ Marketing Manager, Senior/Lead Tech/Web Developer, Senior Graphic designer ^ Campaign Manager, 3 x Graphic designer, Web Developer, Junior Web Developer(the guy who just know how to install and set up wordpress and bit of CSS) And subsequently create some fixed teams - Team 1 (1 Designer + 1 Wordpress Master) Team 2 (1 Designer + 1 Web Developer) Team 3 (1 Designer + 1 Campaign Manager) What do you think? I like fixed teams(with an option for employee to move from one to another) because I think employe will better know in and outs of job nature. But once they get border say to design only facebook pages they can move to web design team But I am still reflecting on cons and pros of flexed and fixed teams. The main con for me of flexed teams is employee has to handle more multitask work and be able to design well as facebook pages, as web design and as to do a branding (logos, flayers, labels etc). With junior employees that's would be difficult. PM Methods: I believe the most progressive and modern method of managing projects now is Agile(Scrum). It was meant for small projects and small teams(5-10 ppl). Gives ability to deliver features quickly.

It looks simple and seems has everything we would need I also have heard good feedbacks about Atlassian Jira. But in my opinion it is too complex as well for our small team. Only what we need is a list of tasks to do assigned for each employee and nicely track the process, with charts and progress bars etc. The management needs to see the work progress.

2413,"How to track development activity time against tasks We are a medium-sized, geographically-dispersed development team using Jira for task management and GIT as our repository. Our developers are generally focused on one primary development project at a time, but their time can often be divided between that project and other, smaller things (sometimes development-oriented and sometimes not). For all development-related work (primary project and otherwise) we track tasks in Jira, but for non-development work we don’t. Our problem is that we want to track development time against tasks and projects, ideally to their Jira tickets, but we have been unsuccessful more than once at getting this off the ground using Jira’s built-in time tracking. The problems we have run into are that time-tracking against Jira tasks is manual, so without frequent reminders the developers forget or ignore tracking often enough to make the tracking records useless. We tend to get off to a good start, but once it seems like everyone is in the groove and the reminders diminish, the time tracking starts to fall off too. Our goal is to find a solution that allows us to track development time against tasks without the need for a lot of manual action by the developers, and ideally that is not too big-brothery. We want a good work environment, but we also want to have time-spent data. If there is anyone who has been able to successfully find a solution to this problem, we would love to hear about it. EDIT... There are several reasons for wanting to do this, but all revolve around the idea of ensuring our engineers are unblocked and working effectively. An engineer could be getting interruptions from other projects, so their output on their main project is suffering. How do we identify that across several teams of engineers? Is someone's lower than expected productivity because they are not getting sufficient instructions, or because they are getting interruptions, or because they are misunderstanding their tasks? An early diagnostic of any of these problems would be seeing that an engineer is completing 8 hour tasks in 16 hours on average - or that they are booking 20 hours of project time per week instead of 40 (or whatever are the appropriate numbers for the engineer or the project, of course). And, no, we're not trying to count keystrokes, or lines of code produced, etc. We're trying to help our engineers be as high-performance as they want to be. Note, we don't use timesheets now - that's one solution that we've tried in the past but we know from experience the frustrations and limitations of that approach.",res,int,-,m,1,1

3318,"Who should decide about changes in the process - Scrum Master or the whole Scrum Team? I need some clarification about how the changes should be introduced within the process in a Scrum Team and how a Scrum Master should approach it. By changes in the process I mean for example: changing the length of a sprint, introducing some practices such as limitting Work In Progress, pair-programming etc. My considerations: Scrum Master manages the process. Mike Cohn's webpage states: ScrumMaster has no authority over Scrum team members, the ScrumMaster does have authority over the process.” (...) ScrumMaster can say, “I’ve decided we’re going to try two-week sprints for the next month.” He also compares Scrum Master to a personal trainer: The trainer cannot make you do an exercise you don’t want to do. Instead, the trainer reminds you of your goals and how you’ve chosen to meet them. To the extent that the trainer does have authority, it has been granted by the client. ScrumMasters are much the same: They have authority, but that authority is granted to them by the team. On the other hand Scrum Guide says: Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. During the retrospective, the whole Scrum Team (including SM) decides about improvement in the process they will introduce. Question(s): So is it like this that : 1.Scrum Master decides that a change will be applied (becuase he has the authority to do so - authority granted by the team). And the team members follows this change, because they trust SM and have respect to SM role. So SM says: “I’ve decided we do this and that” or 2.Scrum Master just proposes the change and then the team makes the decision that they commit to introduce this change? SM says: “What do you think if we try to do this and that?” And what if they do not want this change - he cannot force them to do so, and he can “only” remind of goals and try to convince to follow a change?",int,-,-,e,1,0

Situations where the members of the project team have tasks which are not directly related to their job positions happens quite often (especially in cross-functional teams). According to my experience, this will always decrease the morale of the team. Two examples from my practice: 1) On one project my team had a lot of translation work. In my company we have a special translation department, but the quality of its translations are very poor, they don't have knowladge of the subject area and if we give a translation to them, we will have an external dependency that we can not control well. That's why the development team does all translation work. Of course, no developer wants to do this and it is a great demotivation factor. 2) Another example. Unfortunately, my company eliminated the tester from my team. Developers can test well, but dont want to (and it's logical, if they wanted to test, they would go to work as testers, not as programmers). So, how can we decrease this kind of demotivation? Of course, the answer that we should hire a technical writer or tester on our team is very easy, but in the real world it not always possible. So, a little bit of explanation about what kind of solution I want: for example, if a new project should be done in a well known or even legacy technologies, some companies make special days for developers, when they can work on their own project with any technologies they want. My company has no resourse for such days. But in any new project we try to implement the minor part with new technology.

5239,"How to motivate a team? (software development OOP year 1 degree project) I'm currently in college, working as part of at team for one of the CA projects. it's a problem based learning project where we've been given a trigger and told to come up with something to represent it.We've been assigned to specific teams and we're not allowed change to another team. All problems/issues must be resolved within the team. We've decided to toy around with the idea of a game. The PBL procedure involves assigning roles to each team member and getting stuck in, analysing the problem, deciding on the best way to solve it, getting stuck into UML and coding etc... (we're using Java). However, it seems to me that for the most part my fellow team members seem to lack enthusiasm for the task at hand. After our first lesson one member was assigned the task of printing out special ""trigger"" cards for the purpose of the next meeting, and one was supposed to update the log with the minutes of the last meeting. Now we're in week 3 and I've printed the cards myself and I've had to post on the online log and ask for it to be updated (4 days after the class).I find it quite distressing to be honest. Last week we assigned tasks to each member, namely researching a specific type of game to see the feesability of using it for the project. I regularly composed and sent emails on my progress, ideas of how we could proceed, even diagrams and the beginning of UML class diagrams that might be useful. I got some response form one of the memebrs (4 on the team) but nothing from the others. In the mean time we got a mail from the lecturer saying he couldn't make the next class, but it wasn't an issue, the materials were online and he was just an observer this time anyway. When I got to class the other day, one guy didn't show up, apparently it's too far to drive if there's not even a lecturer there (like the workshop would be much different anyway); and when we got into it, the other lads had come up with ""maybe some sort of pacman game would be good"", but that was it, no research, no ideas on how we might code it, nothing. They completely shot my idea down as too much work, but didn't offer any suggestions to replace it. I'm not the chair person on this team, how can I help motivate them to get stuck in without offending anyone? or maybe the team needs a shake up to get some life into it. I really don't get the lack of interest or excitement, this is a part-time course, everyone has full time jobs, I'd imagine they're here because they have life experience and now know what they want, but listening to them talk, and the lack of ""buzz"" for the want of a better word, about the project doesn't instill confidence in our ability to get it done. It kind of feels like I'm currently the driving force behind it, but I don't want to be pushy; however at this rate I can't see how we can complete the project on time. For the most part they only seem to communicate during college hours. We've set up a shared workspace for task management, scheduling etc, but again no-one seems interested in maintaining it. Is it me? am I expecting too much? am I that annoying ""me! me! me!"" individual in the group? I don't think so, am I wrong getting frustrated at the lack of movement? we're heading into week 4 now and while we've agreed a game ""template"" but it's only because I pushed it, they wanted to wait for the other guy to return, but then we'd be in week 5 of an 11 week project with no movement.

1113,"How to complete many development phases within 2-week Sprints I work in a tech company, a few weeks ago we moved from traditional project management to Scrum multidisciplinary Teams. Our sprints' length is two weeks and the experiment is not working well for now, for some reason we don't achieve the goal at the end of the Sprints. We consider that a user story can be started when the problem is defined and concrete acceptation criteria is defined as well. We consider that a user story is finished when a version, potentially deployable to production with that feature, is created (no further phases needed, only physical deployment). Our work phases are: Demo, retrospective, planning (meeting day) -> 1 day Team talks about the solutions we are going to implement -> Usually 1 day to review possibilities, see how others are doing... When the Team agrees with the solution, the developers may spend 1 day or two investigating some new technology we are going to use -> 1 or 2 days When we know the implementation details of the new technology, we start the implementation knowing the final flows and architectural details -> 3 - 5 days. When implementation is done, we start writing the unit tests, user interface (UI) tests, integration tests... -> 2 - 3 days. When tests are done and new code is covered, we start the code review phase...a reviewer from another Team must be available to check, then we solve any reviewed problems... -> ideally 1 day OK now implementation is done, code review passed, tests written...new feature is sent to a Team QA member to perform final tests and verifications -> 1-2 days. When test passes, the feature is delivered to the Product Owner who performs a User Validation Test -> 1/2 day OK now the feature is ready to merge with the develop branch and a new version is created (and maybe released to production) -> 1 day Problems: If you count, in the best scenario (completing the feature in 3 days and doing tests in 2 days) we spend 11 days to complete the user story...in the worst case we can spend 16 days or more depending on the complexity of the user story...in both cases we exceed the length of the sprint. We could remove phases...but we give importance to quality so writing tests, doing code review, doing a final test phase is relevant to us.

4524,"How do you minimize the impact of a politically necessary “poisonous” team member? I am currently part of a project team evaluating the products of a vendor to develop an integrated solution to several of our legacy systems. I am not the project manager on this particular project, but the designated project manager and I have a very good professional relationship, and I know that she values my feedback on project management issues. Our main problem is the volunteer we are working with. Our parent organization is a non-profit, membership-based organization with a small core of full-time and temporary staff. However, it is common for these staff members to delegate decisions or even entire projects to volunteers from within the organization. We have been told by the parent organization staff member (let's call him Bill) who brought this volunteer (we'll call him Mike) on board that he (Bill) ""doesn't understand the technical details"", so Mike was brought on to ""tell him if our plan makes sense"". Unfortunately, the volunteer sees things very differently. He has made it very clear that he feels he is the project manager, and attempts to take charge of every meeting, regardless of whether it is an internal meeting or one with our vendor. We have repeatedly asked Bill to speak with Mike and clarify his role, as Bill consistently tells us that Mike's role is simply to act as a SME. Each time Bill says he'll talk with Mike, but after every conversation where this has supposedly been ""fixed"", Mike demonstrates the exact same type of behavior. While it might seem easier to simply let Mike lead, it has become very clear that doing so would be a disaster. His background is from a relatively small IT environment (albeit in a leadership role), but his project management skills are non-existent. He has yet to fulfill his role as SME, and has literally wasted months of project time by providing irrelevant documents, attempting to radically redefine the scope of the project, and generally causing problems. I have already told my management team that I do not believe the project can succeed until the problem with Mike is fixed. Both my supervisor and the project manager agree with that statement and openly support it. However, due to the politics it seems like we have to proceed anyway. Are there any strategies that can minimize the damage that Mike will do, while acknowledging the political necessity of not insulting him?

I have heard/seen numerous teams who attempt ""Agile"" but end up falling back to waterfall and that was because the team never strictly followed Agile in the first place. As a background, we (the senior developers) had decided to take over the PM tasks primarily because the company had decided to do away with the PM/AM role in a project (much controvesy, we aren't happy with it but its something we have to live with). It was usually left on to the client to manage the project their style but we developers found it was disastrous. So we felt we needed to bring back a PM process to keep some standard and sanity.

We have a large project to start from scratch and we've hit a roadblock regarding slicing the project. The project is a distributed system with many different components: SQL Server database A couple of web services implementing OAuth 2.0 (which we're rolling ourselves) An audit web service A FHIR web service (eventually) Server-side modules (.NET assemblies) A JavaScript based Single Page Application (SPA) JavaScript based modules housed within the SPA Our own in-house JavaScript framework for building the SPA modules Our first PBI seems so simple: A user can log-in using their smartcard. The problem now is using this user story to vertically slice, as just about all agile advice out there recommends: do we slice across the entire system? If we do, it seems we're biting off a monumental amount; we would need to implement all of the OAuth behaviour including permission verification, most of the JS framework (HTTP handling, template and data-binding), the basics of the SPA and all the database structure and SQL logic that's required just to support this. If we are to see each PBI as a deliverable unit that provides value to the user, there doesn't seem to be a way to break this down.

Most of us are in Western Washington but a few are located in Texas and we lose participation from members of the team because we're doing everything on the computer either locally or via Skype for Business and screen sharing. In my experience of being a scrum master the most effective means of garnering participation and investment in the process was in jobs where we would use printed stories, tape them up on the conference room wall in a roughly horizontal line parallel to the floor in backlog priority order. We would bring stories into the sprint by pulling them those stories off the wall and reaffixing them below the invisible line. That way we could visually see what was in the sprint at any given time by looking around the room. With this visual cue, the developers could process all of this information at their pace and possibly identify dependency issues or even identify missing stories. We'd count story points and compare with our velocity to see how we were doing. Then tasking through the application of sticky notes with rough outlines, an hour estimate, and who was going to be doing the task. Group members would looking at all of the stories would sometimes ask for clarification or talk through the the rough implementation and identify missing tasks or tasks that were under estimated. The actual question: I am looking for an alternate UI that can mimic that ""pull down"" metaphor in an asynchronous manner that was multi-user friendly so that people who are remote can pull a story in or add tasks.

1381,"Global project without a charter, manager nor dedicated resources I am facing a strange situation in one manufacturing company and I need help to figuring out what to do. The company has a very low PM maturity level, especially when it comes to non-manufacturing activities. Global management has recently declared a strategic goal to finally release an internal hardware/software development platform for use in multiple company's manufacturing sites and start training developers to use it. It is being developed on and off for a few years and they now want it completed in 6 months. I am assigned as an architect of the platform - my responsibility is making and enforcing technical decisions because developers in multiple countries are unable to agree themselves. There is no project charter: project is defined by marketing material mostly and developers are to decide what to do and how to do it themselves. That is why I have my role - they can't agree. This also indicates the maturity level of the team. There is no project sponsor: technical department managers (line managers, basically) are expected to spare some resources for common benefit and a strategic goal. There is no project manager: ""because project managers are expensive and busy with manufacturing projects"". To some extent I try to do manager tasks to keep development going. There are no dedicated resources: developers are allowed to work on the project on their spare time (i.e. when there is a gap between commercial projects). Even ""dedicated"" resources like me have other higher priority tasks, in particular those that bring direct revenue. This is not the first iteration like this and managers are not quite happy about wasted resources and developers spending 1000s of hours without completing anything. Platform is already in use by skilled developers, but it is in alpha stage where user/developer has to fix issues when build applications on the platform. Previous iterations were ""completed"" when either deadline came or resources were removed from the project to do something else. Product documentation was simply declared complete and released as is, completion reported to management. I don't know how to approach this. I am not in a position to change situation myself, my expressed concerns are either politely ignored or ""we have heard that before"". I really wish this to succeed, but am lost in how to go towards success. Failure will harm me and will not bring the expected value to he company. What options do I have?

(We're an informal collection, unpaid, collaborating on a common interest.) Some of those decisions, and others, are being challenged. I know that the right move is to remain with the decision, because I personally spent countless hours researching and reaching the same conclusion from different angles about these decisions. I cannot indulge in churn from re-opening old decisions every time someone new shows up. So for now, the decisions are irreversible, barring unforseen circumstances. How do I communicate this? I need ultimately to get buy-in from the team on any given decision, don't I?

1112,"If SAFe must be continuously calibrated and measured in ideal days, why does the framework say recalibration is unnecessary? TL;DR SAFe says you don't need to recalibrate estimation, but requires estimates and other metrics to be normalized across one or more Agile Release Trains. Context, question rationale, and the question itself (stated in a more answerable form) are below. Context of the Question One of the core practices of SAFe appears to be the use of normalized story points on which to base planning and costing decisions within the framework. Version 4.5 of the framework says: SAFe uses a starting baseline where one story point is defined roughly the same across all teams. This means that work can be prioritized based on converting story points to cost...In this way, story points are somewhat comparable to an ideal developer day, and all teams estimate using a common method. Functionally, this results in estimations being done in ideal working days rather than strictly relative level-of-effort scaling. No aspect of the framework appears to offer any alternative to ideal-days estimation, or define a point at which estimation is ever unmoored from man-hours. Furthermore, in the comments section of a now-deleted post, Dean Leffingwell has directly stated that normalized estimates are not a one-time thing. Specifically, he said: Velocities are NOT normalized across teams. Estimating is. If you don’t normalize estimating, then there is no meaningful economics; you can’t figure ROI if you don’t know that the “I” is. If you want to scale agile, and there is no meaningful way to bid work across teams, and within a program, you will be blocked before you even try. Why Ask This Question? The point of the question isn't to debate whether or not this is an anti-pattern, but rather to understand this rather vague note on the page which says: Note: There is no need to recalibrate team estimation or velocity after that point. It is just a starting baseline. Authorial intent here seems unclear. Does it mean no recalibration within a PI Planning increment, or at any point within the process? Given the preceding context, it seems like normalizing of the estimation process (and therefore SAFe-specific application of measures like story points, load, velocity, and cumulative flow) is foundational to the framework. The Question Is there any mechanism within SAFe to estimate in level-of-effort rather than ideal days? In either case, how does the admonition that recalibration is unnecessary fit in with the framework's ongoing requirement to normalize metrics across teams?",int,-,-,m,1,0

To make an example: Lets say you have 3 team members working on multiple different stories. By halfway through the sprint there is no more new tasks, 2 members are sitting at some tasks that still goes on but 1 member has no more task to start.

If we don't take new tasks in the sole member will have to help the 2 others (might not be possible) or work outside the sprint (not recommended either) because we can't end it while 2 members still are working.

Set stage checkpoints where the project should be reviewed and approval to proceed or close is sought and tolerances on set metrics to name a few.

I strongly suspect that the issue is that the current head of the team and his managers have no idea how to set deliverable dates for this kind of work. All of managers come from an analytics background and seem to have no experience with model development. I wrote a memo several months ago encouraging the team to explore an agile development style but this was largely ignored, we are not co-located which makes adoption of pure agile methods difficult in any case. How do I tell the managers to get it together on the project management front and either set sensible milestones for our waterfall tracking (using something like critical chain?) or move to Agile? P.S. for this kind of development work it's extremely difficult to forecast how long development will take until you've done at least a couple weeks of preliminary work (getting data/cleaning data/etc...) .",int,res,sta,i,1,1
4521,"What are the best practices/methods/tools/techniques for conflict identification in requirements? For the sake of this discussion requirements = user-stories (since I'm not differentiating any process per se and would like to get rid of any ambiguities). It's quite common to have a set of about 100-500 requirements for small-medium systems. It's but natural that it takes a while for one to figure out which requirements are conflicting (more so when >1 stakeholder is involved). Either they are capture using Excel or index cards/post-its or maybe in some project management tool. So just how does one go about conflict identification within requirements? What are the practices that you have employed and found useful (w.r.t. time/effort expended and conflicts identified). Is conflict identification even worth it or is it preferable to resolve it 'when you get there' since it could lead to an expectation mismanagement if resolved later? I'm NOT talking about -ility conflicts. Those are but obvious and should be clarified earlier IMO. I'm talking about conflicts between various functional requirements along with functional vs. non-functional clashes. Some examples are: Terminology conflicts - i.e. different terms used to refer to the same concept Structure conflicts - classic one being 'Date' - referred to as MM/DD/YY and as DD/MM/YYYY somewhere else Direct conflicts - giving one requirement will be known to not satisfy another e.g. for a calendar app participants time slots will be private vs the meeting organizer should be able to see the meeting time of all participants before deciding on a meeting slot The latter (direct one) may or may not be negotiable, but identifying it early on will be quite worthwhile IMO. It's quite cumbersome to go through each requirement at a time to identify conflicts. The best is to divide the effort and speed it up. Another strategy is to analyze the requirements hierarchically, but that may hide certain conflicts which would occur in the lower 'nodes' (and those are the ones that come to bite you later IMHO :) I'm not aware of any tools/techniques/best practices that would help one identify conflicts with minimal time/effort overhead and hence the question. The above manual step is the best I know of. Yes, in an ideal world it'd be great to have the tool spew out potential conflicts but I don't know if any tool does it (or even a reasonably good job. Help?) So in an ideal world (without natural language capable machines :) what's the best technique to apply for conflict identification (assuming it's human intensive) and what's been your experience in doing so?

Background: our scrum team's sprint contains stories that belong to a number of our company products and or clients. We build online stores for clients and build reusable internal products for implementation over multiple clients. We also maintain internal development tools. In a sprint we could have: Story: Extend the company's reusable shipping module to handle carrier tracking codes. Story: Build a widget for client x that shows the newest products. Story: Write a functional design for client y's new ERP product importer. Story: Add code format checking to our internal continuous integration server. On average we have around 10 stories per sprint. Sprint goals currently are either: Very broad and non-specific to encompass all stories, which makes it useless as a guideline during the sprint. Very long, pretty much having each story included, which doesn't make it a concise goal to work towards. At first this wasn't really a problem for our team. We'd just pick a general goal and judge progress / decisions during the sprint based on a stories acceptance criteria and definition of done. The scrum guide describes several situations in which it advises to use the sprint goal to judge whether the team is moving in the right direction. As the team's getting better at scrum the need for a valuable sprint goal is becoming more apparent to us.

In most of my experience as a developer, that person has been a project or product manager and some would stay while others wouldn't. Now I'm a project manager and we often have code deployments that have to be done during off hours. Most of the other PMs here do stay for these and I usually do, but only if it's a major deployment. The team is distributed so there is always a phone conference set up and I just call in for minor deployments. However there's still this culture that looks down on you if you don't physically attend every one with your team.

2569,"Concepts of PM tools   I am currently looking for a not-so-complicated PM tool. I haven't done PM very deep so far, and my overall idea about PM and the representation in PM tools is about this: There are some employees who have time to work. There are projects which have to be realized. Projects consist of tasks, which are handled by employees, by spending their work on the tasks. Tasks can be split into sub tasks, can be prioritized and dependencies can be set between tasks. Nothing uncommon. What i expect from a PM tool is that i enter all these information into the tool, and the tool organizes the tasks in a way that the employees are assigned to tasks, and that the tasks are ordered according to their priorities, dependencies and availability of employees. (Ok, assigning employees to tasks is of course done by me.) So that a task starts no earlier than when employees for this task are available and dependencies are met. And when the last task is finished, the project is finished, so the tool tells me how long the project takes. I have been looking around for those tools for quite a while now (several hours searching on the web), but either no tool offers this functionality or it is not visible from the tool description. I wonder, do i maybe have the wrong picture of a PM tool, and i should get a different view on PM in common, or do the tools exist and i have simply missed these features? For example, GanttProject is basically what i'm thinking of, but the tasks still have to be moved by hand, if an employee is working on two overlapping tasks. And it has a bug (since 2008) that when an employee is on vacation, he is still working on the tasks. This simply makes the tool unusable. So the basic question is: Does automatic task organization not work well in practice and does not exist therefore, or do i have missed it?

I am a programming/engineering freelancer working as a consultant for a mid-sized corporation. This mid-sized corporation has many clients, including a very large financial company (one of the top 10 financial companies in the world), who we will call ""Client X"". Years ago (before I started working here), my client created a custom fulfillment website for Client X. I was originally hired to simply implement a new design over the website's existing infrastructure, but soon, I was being given new tasks - bug fixes, small enhancements - and then larger projects - new applications for the website, etc.. The majority of these tasks and projects have been managed using very rudimentary spreadsheets, email communication, and the occasional meeting. I have continually asked for Functional Specifications and/or Business Rules documents from Client X, but they never respond with either. Instead, I'm given a list of one-line tasks/projects and deadlines for each (which are usually unreasonable). In addition to this, Client X rarely helps with any User Acceptance Testing, and instead expect me to simply take their requests, create them, and deploy and have everything work exactly as they requested. When bugs occur, their feathers get very ruffled. They complain about the bugs, and about the time it takes to fix them, etc.. Now, I know that as the sole software engineer for my client, I am responsible for the bugs. However, I feel without proper Project Management, it is more difficult to create bug-free code. As a result of lack of assistance from Client X, I've had to make myself responsible for performing all of the following tasks for each project: Writing Functional Specifications Creating Mock-ups Writing Technical Specifications Programming QA Testing User Acceptance Testing Deployment Bug fixes Project/Task Updates to the client among other things.... Now, don't get me wrong, I enjoy each step of the process - I'm a perfectionist, and I like to be organized. However, I have to admit, that I'm not a great QA or User Acceptance Tester. I'm not a ""normal"" user of the website in question, so I can't think of every scenario to test. Also, the time it would take to properly test each feature takes away from time that I could be working on other projects for Client X. It's a catch 22: they want their tasks/projects done quickly and bug-free, but they don't realize that those two things don't always exist together. The first step I've taken is to start writing Testing Scripts, and to run through these for each task/project I work on. But, there are drawbacks here as well. I'm being paid as a Programmer/Software Engineer. I have no problem being paid my existing rate to test applications/features, but it seems ridiculous to me to pay me as much as they are for this aspect, when they could be paying someone a lot less (idk, $15-20/hour?) to be a tester. Client X complains about the financial implications of me working on bug fixes, but to me, it would just make sense to hire a tester for a lot less money to run test scripts, and free up my time to write code. I've tried explaining these things to my supervisor, who is 1. the liaison for Client X 2. the original programmer for the website, and 3. a VP for my client, but he sticks to the old adage of ""the customer is always right"", and thinks that if they don't want to write Functional Specifications and they don't want to help test and they don't want to use proper Project Management, that WE have to deal with it.

3608,"Update project plan, rescheduling and dates I'm trying to understand the update function in MS Project 2010 and I hope you can help. Let's say I have a road-project where I have divided a task in to several activities based on where the task is performed. To simplify my example I will call the task ""Build Road"". Here are the example activities: Originally, all activities are planned to be built in sequence (top to bottom). After production start we begin having production problems on different stretches. To try and keep the schedule we decide to start working on several fronts. So as a planner in this project I start to follow up the production. To keep track of project finish date and to help manage the project i choose to Update the project and move unfinished work to report date. I keep doing this continuously in the project and after a while my schedule looks like this: Now my questions: Is this a smart way to keep track of project progress? what are the risks? is there a better way? Where can I find the new startdates for the remaining work on the different partial activities? MS Project 2010 gives me the new end dates (and project finish date) but I cant't find the start dates for the different partials. What starts happening if I, mid-way, start to update the durations of some tasks because I have recalculated the project with new capacities? what do I have to keep in mind? For example to increase production to minimise delays. I appreciate any input you can give on this! Thanks! In this project there is not enough time to keep track of resources and work within MS Project so we are only working with durations (no resources or work in the .mpp).

1329,"Single backlog. Multiple teams. How to handle Backlog Refinement? Background Hi all, I am an experienced SM but I thought I would crowdsource a solution to this from peers. The project is an enterprise scale migration to the cloud with over 500 customers representing 300+ applications. The backlog is run by a single Product Owner (also a Cloud Technical Architect) who is supported by a BA. Three teams One backlog Each team has their own stand-ups, sprint planning and retrospectives We have a shared Review with customers Question When dealing with a single backlog which feeds multiple autonomous feature teams, what is the best way to approach Backlog Refinement or ""Play Ready workshops"" or [insert generic name for looking ahead activity]? At present the BA invites all developers from all teams into a single Refinement session to start discussing stories in detail. The devs have, rightly, balked and 19 of the 21 devs just opened their laptops and started coding again. They have requested an approach where the BA spends time understanding the story in detail through 1-2-1 sessions with devs and only bring those stories to the Refinement session to see if they are ready for Sprint Planning the next week. The BA has balked at this approach since it would be 3 Refinement sessions, also predicting which team takes which stories from the backlog etc. The Product Owner is swamped conducting technical assessments/communications for the app migrations and has devolved story preparation to the BA's. They are at an impasse and morale has dropped off a cliff. As the most experienced SM, the other SM's have handed this hospital pass to me to solve.

The story was completed and in testing the team discovered that it didn't work as required for one class of users. The developer who did the work thought it was a permissions issue and should be fairly easy to fix. We logged a bug and prioritized it in the third sprint. It appeared to be a problem with the open source framework we are using. Developer tried installing some patches that appeared could be related. Didn't help. The Product Owner agreed to carry the bug to the fourth sprint at the request of the developer, however with a low priority. On seeing more time being wasted on it, the Product Owner moved it to the backlog. Now we are in the sixth and final sprint and getting the product ready for beta release.

Namely, they already have a deadline, then they set milestones in a backwards order. They apply the same approach on each milestone to figure out what they need to do to accomplish the goal of each milestone. Example: Project: Super important business meeting in Las Vegas I have an appointment in Las Vegas at 13hrs.

Or it could be that we're asking the other team to engage with us in the development process - discovering requirements and impacts, planning, validating, and then delivering.

We might already have one with a performance of 98%, but we need a new one (from scratch) which can deliver 99%. The main steps will look something like this: Do a literature study Acquire some pictures of cats and dogs. Perhaps also some code to handle the images. Train a algorithm based on the data and test the accuracy. Make some final validation of the results Implement the working prototype into a product. Step 1,2,4 and 5 are easy and can be broken further down if needed. However, step 3 is way to big and way to uncertain to just be a story by itself. Experience shows that the progress will be something like: Train the algorithm using the de facto method found in the literature study Realize that you need better performance, but might be able to get it by incorporating some special information in this specific use case. Apply tweak #1 which turns out to improve the performance by x% Apply tweak #2 ..... ..... n tweaks later you have reached the goal of 99% corrected predictions. However, since adaptation/tweaking is the main part of the work and it's often impossible to predict the number of tweaks needed, the effect of a tweak and the type of tweaks in advance.

2111,"Being pressured into doing a Gantt chart Currently in a proxy product owner/Scrum master role, I do my planning in the following way: Weekly Retrospectives at the end of the week, sprint review on Mondays (with the stakeholder) followed by a Sprint planning meeting. My boss the product owner has been asking me to show a gantt chart for a couple of months. I have been really pushing back on doing this because of the following reasons: It's based on time when I measure performance based on the teams velocity It is too high level. Currently one of the problems that I am currently seeing is where our original plan gets skewed by unforeseen customer requests, resulting in new features being developed for the platform which we did not originally scope. Since I do my planning weekly, I am able to adapt to change requests as they come in by adding it in the following sprint. If I have a gantt, the planning becomes very rigid if followed 100%. I do not want to commit to it, only for it to bite me in the ass with my boss saying 'you promised x and y thing on week 7 why hasn't it been delivered?' irrespective if we were forced to work on other things in that time. I am thinking about doing a high level gantt chart just to keep my boss happy. Can I do this (even if it is inaccurate) on a sprint by sprint bases? We aim to complete x y think on x week then z thing on y week. UPDATE TO SINCE THIS QUESTION WAS POSTED I have been doing this for 2 weeks Pros of Gantt Charts Gives a high lever overview on how you plan to structure upcoming sprints, that is easy to see. It can be used as a product roadmap. Drawbacks Too rigid, cannot adapt to change at all. I have found that once requirements came in that were not originally specced, it went out of whack. You can probably use a Gantt chart as long as you inform your stakeholder that it is subject to change.",sch,-,-,p,1,1
974,"When working closely with sales, does storypoints still make sense vs time estimations The main idea behind using story points is to take away focus on the absolute time/cost of a task and look at the relative sizing vs the other tasks you have in front of you. This has worked well in all the other companies I have worked in. Here the typical setup is that you have a software team, working on a product, and a product owner which can use the story point estimations to prioritize one feature over another for the next sprint and/or release. However, in my current position it's a bit different. We develop software for a hardware platform we sell to customers. However, all sales requires us to tweak our software to match the customers' needs[1], and this tweaking is often a significant cost for the company when selling a product. Therefore sales/management always needs an estimate of how time-consuming various customer-related tasks are, so they can factor this number into their offers when they bid on jobs. We spend roughly 50% of our time integrating our base software into customer specific solutions, and 50% of the time on improving our base system. Question: In this case. Does it even make sense to try to abstract away time/money from the development using story points, since numbers are always so close anyway? When sales comes and asks: ""[The customer is willing to pay $1 million extra for feature X,] how expensive is feature X to develop?"" It's impossible to not look at the number $1 million then the amount of story points for the task, and make a direct transformation. You could argue that you should not tell the developers about the actual number, but I don't like this for two reasons: I don't know what you actually gain from it here. You still need a direct story point->time->cost transformation We are only around 20 people in total, 8 in software. A sale is a huge thing, and I think taking away information of how everything is going would stress people more than giving them peace of mind to ""just work on development"".

I am not focus on pure waterfall vs pure scrum conversion. I am more incline of solving the following problems that are being caused by our very rigid waterfall implementation. As everything in big corporations, there is a little of fault in red tape and additional politics, but at heart of the problem is the Waterfall methodology that we currently follow. Here are the symptoms: Business Requirements have very little quality since they hand-off these requirements at the beginning meeting a date for IT to start the software analysis. This frustrates the IT teams and use some of the development time to clear some of these bad requirements. Because Business requirements are not completed on time or have little quality, development usually develops the wrong thing, causing re-work. Because rework is necessary, and changes are unavoidable the QA team usually end up without the time to do proper work. In order to get anything in a release we have to estimate without requirements, this causes a list of things that the business wants but is unattainable because time to develop is inflated (mainly politics issue) This department of 40-50 IT pros, have been trying to step out of waterfall into scrum for a year now, but is causing a lot of issues. Issues like (1) people using scrum to hide on the fact that requirements are not ready (2) other IT departments that don't use scrum complain about the process. I have decided to try a 12 weeks scrum pilot. Shoot for a strict scrum implementation where that team will have a product owner that will be responsible for what is important. I think this will be the key of having a successful implementation. Right now the business is not accountable for their deliveries, and I think they should be. I will split these 12 weeks in 3 sprints of 3 weeks with 2 weeks of planning the pilot and 1 week of releasing to production.

3721,"Agile methodology for small company; large projects + ticket maintenance  I work for a small company of 6 multi-skilled developers where we have developed our own product which requires constant improvement but also maintenance and support, both for the current release from end users and from other areas of the business. This results in developers having to dedicate time to both development work and responding to requests for support and maintenance. As a result, the quality time that can be spent on development is squeezed, thus putting more pressure on the developers. As a company, we have adopted agile methodologies and are working in sprints; we specify our projects using user stories and use story points to do estimates. However, the significant amount of unplanned and unpredictable work that comes in due to end user support requests and requests from other areas of the business that the developers have to deal with makes it very difficult to plan effectively. I need a better way to organize the development team's time to enable us to plan more effectively and get quality development time while still maintaining our obligations to respond to support requests, fix bugs and respond to requests from other areas of the business.

1864,"How can I produce more reliable estimates for technology refresh projects? After running a few projects that refresh technology rather than add functionality, I've noticed a few recurring themes: Technology refresh projects are more likely to go over budget/schedule; projects that provide incremental new features are less likely to exceed budget & schedule estimates. Development teams are more likely to underestimate technology refresh projects. New functionality tends to have well-defined requirements. Old functionality is always a journey of discovery, especially on widely deployed products with history of customer-driven fixes and enhancements. A large part of this hidden legacy only comes out after the team has a chance to make serious headway with refactoring. All of that makes early feasibility assessment and ROI analysis on such projects challenging. I've tried two techniques to address this. One technique is to add a constant tax on top of team's estimates, but that can be crude and imprecise, since refactoring projects are not born equal. Another is to delay estimate and schedule projections until the team has spent reasonable effort flushing out the hidden costs.

4572,"How do unknown-scope projects achieve project-level estimation with regards to the CMMI's Project Planning Specific Goal? Specific Goal (SG) 1 of the Project Planning process area in CMMI (assessed at CMMI Level 2) is to establish estimates. One of the Specific Practices (SPs) that is recommended to achieve this goal is to estimate the scope of the project. In all of the CMMI literature that I have access to, it explicitly calls out the creation and maintenance of a work breakdown structure (WBS) to achieve this goal. However, not all projects have a clearly defined scope at the outset, making the creation of a WBS (or any type of project-level estimation) difficult. I'm aware that the CMMI is a process framework that's designed to be tailored, but the frequent and explicit mentions of the use of a WBS, rather than the use of example tools, to achieve this goal is rather confusing. The use of a WBS, specifically the 100% rule, appears to me to be difficult to achieve in many such environments: The 100% rule states that the WBS includes 100% of the work defined by the project scope and captures all deliverables – internal, external, interim – in terms of the work to be completed, including project management. Agile methodologies are best suited to this situations, when the project requirements or scope are not well understood. If you don't fully understand the requirements and/or scope, it's not possible to create a 100% complete WBS for the entire project scope. A WBS is better suited in a plan-driven project where the requirements are less volatile and the scope of the project is well defined. One possible option would be to create and continually refine the WBS to accurately reflect the current understanding of the project, that seems to go against the principles of agile/lean documentation. In terms of the overall process, the existance of the WBS adds no value to the development team and producing and modifying it is wasteful. Another option might be to create a WBS on a per-iteration basis (especially if the iterations are longer), but this would be capturing the same information that might be captured in the form of the product backlog, stories, use cases, and just reformatted to ""check the box"" of having a WBS, which again doesn't seem very agile/lean. I found one academic paper (PDF) that appears to suggest that the appropriate mapping from Scrum to this process area is to indeed create a WBS at the beginning of each sprint. However, some aspects of this paper make me question if the authors have a good grasp of Scrum as a project management framework. For example, the authors write There are not explicit orientations in SCRUM to establish, for instance, size and/or complexity of items of Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog. This is true, however individual teams generally develop a consistent process for determining these values. For example, a common method is using Planning Poker to determine the Story Points associated with each User Story in the backlog. The Scrum framework allows teams to choose what works for them, and encourages consistency when peforming such a task. There are also a few other instances of similar questionable statements. I'm well aware that the identified Specific Practices (SPs) in CMMI are a model for organizations to follow. An organization can develop their own practices, as long as they meet the Specific Goal (SG) of the area. Many of the SPs are written to be along the lines of ""best practices"" for projects, process, quality, and continuous improvement and can be applied to any project. In addition, the SPs provide examples of tools, techniques, and methodologies that might be used to carry out the practice to achieve the goal. However, SP 1.1 (Estimate the Scope of the Project) is something that can't (easily) be done on a number of projects with vague scope, yet must be addressed somehow to achieve/maintain CMMI Level 2. What techniques have organizations used to achieve this goal on projects with a poorly-defined scope in a manner acceptable within the CMMI framework and reach or surpass CMMI Level 2? Are there any issues with introducing alternative means of producing estimates during an audit? What feedback has been provided by the SEI or CMMI auditors to companies regarding what should be done regarding projects with vague scope? Is this a practice that can simply be neglected in projects that are difficult to estimate as a whole unit, as long as the specific goals of establishing estimates for work and tasks, defining life cycles, and smaller scale cost/effort estimations are maintained?",sco,sch,-,p,1,0

842,"PM techniques/tools for fixed-price 6 month client project I am looking for project management techniques and tools to help with the following situation. (P.S. I know this question is technically off-topic but I felt Revisiting Tool Recommendation Questions expressed a degree of leeway. I am new to project management. I'm sure the community has a lot of useful advice for me.) We are doing a software development project for a client which has a fixed budget (about USD 100k) and fixed time (about 6 months). I have a team of developers working on it. The requirements are clear (and I've worked with this client many times before so I don't predict big problems there.) My question is, how can I keep this project on track in terms of time and budget? (If I go over budget then that'll be very frustrating, despite all the work we're going to put into the project, it would make more sense for me to fire everyone and just sit in Starbucks all day... I really want to avoid that!!) I'm thinking, you can't change the past, but you can change the future. So I need to keep a track on the costs that have happened, and the predicted costs and effort in the future. And keep a constant eye on whether we're predicted to hit the time and budget constraints, and if not, try to take action. The sooner I know the more chance there is of being able to correct course; if I find out the night before the deadline we're not going to make it, it's too late to correct it. Here's what I've considered: Scrum. Dividing the project up into sprints. But, because I know what all the sprints are going to contain ahead of time, it's not really ""agile"". Is this a good/useful option? Use a tool such as MS Project Online, LiquidPlanner or similar, to enter all tasks and estimates. Team knows what to do, team updates estimates and tasks as soon as things change. I keep a constant eye on spent budget, predicted budget, predicted delivery date. Which tools should I look at there? Use an offline tool such as Excel or MS Project (offline). And have weekly status meetings where everyone has to update me. I have the worry that then I'll be a week behind (e.g. I've literally seen such situations; have the meeting Monday morning, on Monday afternoon a big problem is discovered, the plan is out-of-date until the next Monday, a week is lost during which preventive action could be taken). Plus nobody likes those big status meetings. Plus they cost a lot. Bonus features I'd love: Handling uncertainty somehow, e.g. a screen in the framework we already know can be predicted reasonably accurately, a piece of research less so. Ideally ""min 0.5 days, expected 1 day, max 5 days"" or something. Real world estimates such as ""1 day of effort"" as opposed to ""7 story points"" I don't have to spend ages moving Gantt bar charts around the place. Ideally I say ""this takes 1 week of effort, and can't be started before this other task finishes, and this person is on holiday on those weeks"" and the tool tells me if it'll be done by the deadline or not. Dependencies, critical path analysis, so I know which work to look at in case we're not going to meet the deadline. Display of how long people have got work for e.g. ""Bob runs out of work in 2 weeks, Joe in 3 months"", so I can decide who should take on new tasks. ""what if analysis"" like ""if I add another developer to the team, will it help the deadline, assuming we have to train them, and maybe development isn't on the critical path""? Ideally web based. Not PC/Mac based; so it's cross-platform for my team, and ideally not paper-based to support people who aren't always working from the office. Generate reports with nice KPIs such as what % of the project we're through to present to the client. (Nice to have) Tool is not slow and difficult to use and annoying. (Nice to have) I don't mind about cost, if I can avoid a financial disaster with this project then I'm happy to pay for it! EDIT/ADDITION: Thanks to Erik for the question ""What kind of action are you going to try and take, if the project has fixed budget, fixed time, and fixed scope?"" Here's what I was thinking: I can ask the client for more time. It might be OK for the client or it might not be but it's worth asking. It's never ideal to ask for more time, but if I have a 6 month project and I ask for 2 extra weeks in the middle, I think it sounds more professional than if I ask for those 2 extra weeks the night before the deadline. And if the client is doing marketing activities based around the deadline, it might really be no problem to postpone them 4 months before the deadline, but be a real problem to postpone them if you let them know a few weeks before the deadline. I can ask the client for more budget, or to reduce scope. Again, far from ideal! But I've done it, and it does sometimes work. Again, doing it with months still to go allows for a better conversation with the client than the night before the deadline, where some of the features the client might offer to drop have already been developed (so dropping them would now no longer help). Reduce exploratory work. Maybe the team is spending time exploring new technologies (e.g. new software frameworks or whatever). Such things can help the project, or not, one doesn't know at the start, if they're time they're definitely worth investigating. I can terminate such activity and assert we'll use technologies we already know. (This example comes from my actual experience.) Potentially put other people on the project, if it's just a question of time and not cost. Always a risky move. But, at least it's an option if there are months still to go. It's not an option if there's only two weeks to go. Better to know about the problem sooner than later. Discovering risks as soon as possible seems to make sense to me. You're going to make better decisions the more information you have (i.e. it's better to know it's going wrong 2 weeks in, than not to know.)",int,res,-,i,1,1

Precondition for applying EVM is that tasks or results are well defined and well distributed during the project. I'm wondering if it is possible to apply EVM to projects with a high probability of change, e.g. R&T projects. Within R&T projects unforeseen iteration may appear or a former closed task has to be reopened due to new findings. Those aspects are usually not understood as risk, due to the fact that everybody expects them to appear. Regarding R&T vs. R&D: For sure, EVM is successfully applied on lots of development projects. From my point of view, EVM is a tool to visualise results or effects caused by the usual uncertainty of projects managed by waterfall model (e.g. delays, changes in estimate at completion). Regarding the TRL, R&D is situated somewhere between 4 and 8 (my impression). In compare to that, R&T is situated somewhere between 1 and 6 (again my impression). In addition, I state that the level of uncertainty decreases with higher TRL: Ones estimates get more robust regarding project planning aspects (e.g. time, schedule, tasks) as higher the TRL is. Those are quite general statement and for sure not always correct or applicable. Nevertheless they reflect (at least my) general observations.

The legacy web application is written in Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS and there are approximately 4000 html files with NodeJS as backend (so its a fairly big application). Now migrating such a big application to a new technology stack will need some kind of planning to avoid bottlenecks at a later stage in the project execution phase. Some challenges with this migration will also involve convincing the stakeholders about the benefits of the migration + there will also be a learning curve needed for the technical(developer) staff. Also since the migration effort might take some time to complete, we will also need to keep supporting the existing legacy application in the meantime. So the agility for the existing application needs to continue in parallel to the new migration effort. Any ideas / references / insight here will be highly appreciated in planning such a complex project.

At first glance it seems as if we are too optimistic when we are planning and committing.

The daily stand ups with the questions ""What have I done yesterday"", ""What problems did I hit"", ""What I'm gonna do today"" sounds to me like a pretty good risk investigation and the retro meeting at the end of sprint being a lot longer than an usual stand up meeting is giving a chanse to analyze in more depth things that the team thinks are important.

I am trying to schedule resources who have other (management) duties not related to the project. My initial thought was to reduce their availability (Max Units) - for example, a manager might be set to 85% availability. If I'm using work-driven tasks, then this as the desired effect of spreading the duration out over a longer period of time. Things get problematic when I want to schedule, for example a meeting where that resource attends along with other resources. The meeting would be a duration-based task, say 3 hours in length. If I have 4 resources attending, I want that listed as 12 hours of work for billing purposes, so in that case all 4 resources need to be allocated at 100% for that task. This is where it gets ugly - when leveling the resources, I always get errors, because you're not supposed to be able to allocate an 85% resource for 100% on a task. Is using resource allocation / Max Units the way to go here?

610,"How to handle project that (I think) not using any framework or has unclear workflow? Let me describe what's in the project, The people involved in this project is: Company owner Project owner Consultant 4 software engineers I'm one of the software engineers there. The responsibility/what they do are: Company owner Most of the requirement is defined by them and transferred to the Owner of the project (I assume this is done orally, there's really no documentation about this) Project owner Brief the software engineers about the requirement from the company owner by telling it in the meeting. Verify the progress by watching the application runs demonstrated by the engineers and sometimes by handing the app to the future user of the app. Listen to the Company owner/user feedback and translate it to a new requirement that soon briefed to the engineer. Discuss with the consultant/engineer what is the best practice when dealing with a problem/requirement. The project owner has other many responsibilities, so the availability is somewhat limited. Consultant Get asked opinion from the project owner about what is the best practice from a problem/requirement. Tell/influence the project owner if some requirement is just too difficult to manage later. The consultant just appear once in a while, so doesn't always available to engineer onsite (maybe available to the project/company owner) Software Engineers Develop the project Writing/take notes about the briefed requirement Demonstrate/report the project progress. Note: this is from my point of view. there's no handbook about this Project Management Tools Notepad/ Text Editor Trello Slack The problem The project owner admits that the requirement isn't all clear, it needs to be discussed with the company owner and all the potential user. So often the requirement changes. The requirement isn't documented by a framework so it is just a text from a full meeting. The meeting text isn't always verified by the project owner. The text is just a brief description of a new feature and the constraint, not really detailed like a flow diagram, sequence, etc. I think the project owner just assume what he thought about was already stated in the meeting and the engineers wrote all the correct description about it and will implement as is. After a meeting passed, the text will be posted to slack and break down by the engineer to the trello board. The project owner and the consultant can read the slack and the trello board. But there wasn't any complain/correction made to those document. I have a feeling, there may be an occasion where it's not correctly written. But seems it just got away every time. The structure of the trello card isn't defined either. Sometimes it titled by the module engineers worked with and contains checklists of the break-downed task from the meeting (not really detailed) [1]. Sometimes it is just a single task with a little bit detailed description [2]. Maybe that's why there's no complain/correction, but I already talked about it. The project owner & consultant seems just agree and let the engineer take care of it. And in my opinion, the review process from the project owner seems doesn't complete. It just jumped from one to another feature. When it seems partially complete the project owner already jumped to review another feature. And sometimes just adding more requirement to be done. When I asked my teammate, they feel that although we finished developing a feature, it doesn't feel complete. I want to propose better project management for this situation, but I haven't really had the experience to say. What kind of project management can be put into work there?

5235,"How do I get my manager to understand that our project needs to stop here, and that we have to be on a new track? Let's say, I've been working on a watch. This is your ordinary pocket watch, it has hands, gears, shows the time... About a month passes, and they want us to make this into a wrist-watch, still with the analog design, but fits nicely onto your wrist. They don't want to spend the time making a wrist-watch from scratch because we already have a pocket watch-- and they're kind of the same. After a bunch of work, and an awful mess of gears, the watch is now a wrist watch, somewhat bulky but it is passable as a wrist watch. Time passes, and they actually want this wrist watch to be a grandfather clock, instead of building one from scratch, because they both tell time. So I scope out a design that will be easy to make this into Big Ben, so when we're done the grandfather clock we can make the next demand suitable. Except, they now want wrist watch again, but with a digital read out, not analog. So we have to make the gears display analog time. This is driving me insane, and I can't find a way to explain that these software projects that all seem similar are actually very different. They don't understand because they have a legacy system that's huge and ugly, as well as a new pocket watch that was small and simple and met the goals as originally scoped out, they want the pocket watch to grow into a LCD version of Big Ben.

With varying teams delivering varying pieces of an overall solution it has become increasingly difficult to recognize when a given version of an application must be delivered with another application and different version that fits in to the overall solution. This same scenario surfaces where one application of the overall solution could be delivered prior to the other application but not the other way around. A hypothetical example could be that there are 4 applications that make up an end to end solution of which serves varying user bases. What I'm struggling with is a way to track inter/intra dependencies across the applications in a simple and digestive manner that doesn't require a wealth of brainpower throughout the day to day tasks across the teams. I've attempted to use tooling (SpiraTeam) as well as looked at a simplistic matrix within Excel however those have yet to solution the problem. I've also thought about making use of the version numbers themselves to quickly identify impact however that became cumbersome and not maintainable. I'm looking for perhaps a one-off solution and or previous experience that does not require an entire process/paradigm shift to make this happen. Does anyone have any experience in effectively tracking inter-dependent applications and more importantly the release cycles of the inter-dependent applications within the Enterprise? UPDATE: To further elaborate, the dependencies are at varying layers within the applications. An example would be the front end of a given application, which talks to the applications back end which talks to yet another application via services. In this example the deliveries must go in parallel yet are operating independently on separate application versions. These undoubtedly spawn due to feature level deliveries however our current paradigm of versioning does not explicitly capture the feature within the version number itself making that connection more difficult. The plan is that it would be manipulated by the entire team which is in due part to the varying interdependence and each owner respectively being closest to that knowledge and interdependence. The end result is then a quick visual to identify that a given application can precede another version or maybe they have to go in parallel, etc... I have explored a simple matrix within Excel however it felt cumbersome since the version definition, versioning maintenance, etc.. happen within another tool. The problem with the tool is that it does not allow inter-connectivity across projects (applications) which would alleviate this issue at the point where I feel it should be solved.",sch,-,-,m,1,1

Once we find out the hours estimate, then we can arrive at the cost of the project. Hence, one approach is to run a sample sprint of one week, selecting a few features from the product backlog. If the team completes 50 story points in 250 hours, then each story point costs 250/50 = 5 hours. So if we estimate, overall, 1,000 story points, then the estimate of hours will be 5 x 1,000 = 5,000 hours. The team has to decide on the DoD (definition of done) before coming to this estimation.

Lately, our CTO has requested me to use gitflow and while I found it good and organized I can't seem to fit it in our development process.

Cannot be done on development since it'll have unfinished features, probably broken code, we could do it on a QA environment or staging but then again, if they want to be able to cherry-pick features to deploy to production, and QA already has, say 3 features, how would you do that?

A private ""thank you""? An e-mail to their manager with praise? Any other ideas?",res,qua,comm,e,1,0

2383,"Developers in Scrum Team: ineffective and not functional I am part of a small company that has 6 developers and 2 support members. this team has been participating in ""Agile"" development practices for the past 3 years. The Agile/Scrum method has never been truly adopted. They would simply just use a Backlog to look at everything the team was doing, and use Sprint meetings to update what they been working on for the past day, and what they are working on right now. After not seeing any yield from this methodology I was brought in as Scrum Master to improve the teams cooperation and effectiveness. So far I have the team now assigning effort to items and measuring approximate work. However, the team seems to still be stuck in their methods of this is my work and I only let you know progress updates. There is a serious lack of team work when approaching backlog items and tasks. Everything that team approaches has a monolithic approach. The idea that this backlog item will only be approached by one developer until it is done. I want to transform this culture that has been so pervasive in this team. What is the best way as the Scrum Master to get this team to work together as developers? I am sorry if I was not clear enough. If you need any more details I will be happy to give you more information.",int,res,-,m,1,1
5114,"How to determine how good someone estimates their time? I am very often in an environment where the employees performing the work are constantly rolling over to new employees and these employees are allowed to estimate on their own how long tasks will take. I have found that the error in their estimates always seems to be the same. Like if Bob over estimates on task 1, he is very likely to over estimate on task 2 as well. Same thing if Jim under estimates on 1 he will probably under estimate on task 2 as well. So my question, is there any way to perform a quick test of sorts to identify these trends before starting into actual work? This post seemed to hit some of my questions, and I like the PERT method as described by Bill the Lizard. Ideally what I would like is to be able to very quickly identify if I need to change the weights of Optimistic, Expected, and Pessimistic for that person in order to better estimate how long it will take. Since there is such a fast roll over it seems like about the time the employee has done enough estimates/work to know how to treat their estimates they end up moving on. So, any suggestions on how to handle this? Would going with something other then PERT work better? And PS, the fast roll over is due to it being a student driven group so it is expected that the student will leave once they graduate.",res,sch,-,m,1,1
3808,"Why does our Sprint Planning not align with our original Release Plan? Our scrum team has provided high level estimates for the project we are working during release planning meeting. The team provided guesstimated hours as well as Story points for each of the stories in the release backlog. Based on this we arrived at an end date and communicated it to the client. As we got into Sprints, we got into a situation where the stories in the backlog needed to be decomposed into multiple stories and as a result of that our end date got pushed out and we communicated the same to the customer and he was OK with it. We were having regular product backlog grooming sessions as well. But, when we get into Sprint planning meeting, the team's estimate on user stories are again changing and again as a result of that the stories are getting decomposed and the size of the stories also increasing - with this the end date for the release backlog also having an effect. And this happened more than couple of occasions for our release backlog. Where are we getting it wrong? How could we rectify the situation so that the team can finish what was committed to client during release planning OR at least come close to what was promised? Thanks",sch,-,-,p,1,1
4058,"How to apply daily stand-up meetings with a large team on multiple projects Background There are: 4 .Net Developers 4 PHP Developers 2 QA Specialists 2 Integration Specialists 2 Analysts 3 PMs 11 Projects in active development. None are trivial. Some are programs with sub-projects. I am the 4th PM tasked with adding method to the madness. I am trying to take the org Agile. My short term goal is to implement daily stand ups and Sprint planning (probably end up being more Kanban than Scrum). The environment is multiple eCommerce and SaaS sites, so at any given time something can break and send all plans to the wind. The Challenge: We can't have 11 stand ups a day, nor can we perform work on 11 projects a day. Option 1: Each PM has one stand up for the projects they want to focus on; however, some team members will be on all three and therefore need to attend 45 min worth of stand-ups every day. Option 2: We have one massive stand up with 17 people. This would have the most transparency as to what project/task each person is/has been working on. However; how long would such a meeting need to be? How long would people end up listening to issues that do not apply to them? Option 3: I don't know, you tell me.",sch,res,-,e,1,1
2298,"MS project 2010 resource assigning problem - unexpected behavior I define a fixed work task, work is 16 h. I assign a resource Bob to work 100% on this task. The task duration is automatically set to 2 days. Since I figure out Bob won't have full time to spend on this task, I double click on the task to add Alice to the resources. I assign Alice to work 50% time on the task and change Bob from 100% to 50%. When applying the change, duration automatically changes to 2,67 days. Why? Two persons are working on a 16 h fixed work task, each with 50%. Why is there 0,67 days more scheduled than needed? In case in the same task now I delete all resources and click OK and then insert resources again, now for Bob and Alice I assign 50% availability at the beginning, the calculation is correct. 2 days needed for the task to complete. No other changes were made - just resources deleted and entered again. When the problem is present and I check the Team planner, I can see that Bob and Alice do not work the whole task duration. Note - the project is fresh, no calendars are used, no special cases. If anyone can help me to understand, what's going on, I will be very grateful.

73,"In Jira Kanban, do we change assignee as a work item goes through the workflow? Let's say our workflow is like this: DEVELOPMENT, CODE_REVIEW, TESTING, DONE. Developers get assigned to work items and start working on them. When an item is implemented it needs to be reviewed by another developer from the team - should we change the Assignee field from the developer who was implementing it to the developer that will be reviewing it? And the same question when an work item needs to go from CODE_REVIEW to TESTING - should we assign it to a tester? If we don't change the Assignee field filed then the item becomes kind of un-owned when it transitions from DEVELOPMENT to CODE_REVIEW (or from CODE_REVIEW to TESTING) - nobody will consider themself responsible for this item (especially when they have their own unfinished work items). But if we change the Assignee field then we lose the information about the original developer - it doesn't seem to be convenient.",sch,res,-,e,1,1
